<p><img class="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/UwUtEtc.png"></p>

<p>Recently I became aware of the <a href="http://canarytokens.org">canarytokens</a> project by the guys over at <a href="http://thinkst.com/">Thinkst</a>. The basic idea is to manipulate things like documents / services in such a way that usage thereof will trigger an alert via some form of &lsquo;phone home&rsquo; feature. The is most probably better known as &lsquo;honeydocs&rsquo;. In the case of <a href="http://canarytokens.org">canarytokens</a>, the phone home features can be either via a DNS or HTTP request coupled with a unique token. As paraphrased from the projects website, this is no new groundbreaking idea but just another usable one.</p>

<p>In this post, I just want to take a few moments and jot down my findings when investigating the documents generated by this project.</p>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>Flick II just got published on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/flick-2,122/">Vulnhub</a>! You should try it =)</p>

<h2>introduction</h2>

<p>After about a year since <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/flick-1,99/">Flick I</a>, I have finally managed to get Flick II out to VulnHub. I learned a lot from Flick I and as a result applied it to Flick II. The making of Flick II was also a very different story. If I have to compare it to the first one (which took 3 nights to build start to finish), Flick II took <em>waay</em> longer. I think the total build / testing time must be over a month.</p>

<p>Originally I had a whole bunch of ideas, and after lots of trial and error, came to what it has become today. I have to give a special shouts to <a href="https://twitter.com/s4gi_">@s4gi_</a> for the inspiration to go with the mobile app idea and <a href="https://twitter.com/barrebas">@barrebas</a> for testing the first <em>really</em> broken version :P</p>

<h2>preparation</h2>

<p>I believe Flick II will be the first Vulnerable VM on <a href="https://twitter.com/VulnHub">@VulnHub</a> with a mobile twist to it. That means you will need to either install the bundled <code>.apk</code> on an Android phone, or run it in an Android emulator in order to progress on the path to root! The <code>.apk</code> is self-signed so expect Android to complain about that if you install it on a phone. Don&rsquo;t feel bad if you don’t trust me (aka. some random guy on the internet). If you don’t, your safest bet then is to use an emulator. The only real requirement for the <code>.apk</code> is that the mobile app must be able to speak to the VM and be run on a relatively recent Android version.</p>

<p>I hope you get to learn as much as I did making it!</p>

<p>Good luck! :D</p>

<p>Recently I came across a few <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous integration servers. A relatively old version I might add but that fact was not important. What was important though was the fact that it was not configured to be <em>&lsquo;secure&rsquo;</em>. Right out of the box Jenkins does not require any authentication to make use of it. In fact, it seems like its almost plug and play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>introduction</h2>

<p>Recently I decided I wanted to have a look at what <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/">Exploit Exercises</a> had to offer. I was after the memory corruption related exploitation stuff to play with, until I saw the details for <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/">Nebula</a>. <em>Nebula covers a variety of simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6K9zeta.jpg"></p>

<p>I did not really have a lot of time on my hands and figured I should start with the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; stuff. Many of the levels Nebula presented were in fact very, very easy. However, towards final levels my knowledge was definitely being tested. Levels started taking much longer to complete as I was yet again realizing that the more you learn, the more you realize you you still have to learn. :)</p>

<p>This is the path I took to solve the 20 challenges.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/vulnhub-is-0b10.html">Vulnhub is 0b10</a> years old. That is binary for 2 :) In order to celebrate this, <a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse</a>
 created <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sokar-1,113/">Sokar</a>.</p>

<p> <img class="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/brPBCGq.png"></p>

<p>Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/">Persistence</a> challenge from Sep &lsquo;14.
From the <a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html">competition announcement blogpost</a>, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.</p>

<p>Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!</p>

<p>Here is my entry for the competition. Enjoy! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>introduction</h2>

<p>Not too long ago, I toyed with a <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/02/09/no-more-jailbreak-detection-an-adventure-into-android-reversing-and-smali-patching/">Android root detection bypass</a>. In a similar scenario, I was poking at a iOS application that also had some root detection built in. For very much the same purpose, I suppose the application has its own ~reasons~ for the jailbreak detection. Of course, this makes the testing I <em>actually</em> wanted to do impossible as I&rsquo;d very much like to dig under the hood :)</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/hWgQMnl.png"></p>

<p>So, its was time to try and bypass the jailbreak detection of the application.
All I had to work with was a <code>.ipa</code>. Similar to the android <code>.apk</code> file, the <code>.ipa</code> is also just a zipped up archive of the actual application files. To test with, I had a iPad mini. The iPad was running the latest iOS (8.1.2 at the time of this post) and was also jailbroken. If I remember correctly the jailbreak tool used was called TaiG. Anyways, inside the applications <code>.ipa</code> archive was a whole bunch of resource files and what not, including the compiled application executable. This executable is what is of interest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>introduction</h2>

<p>I will start by saying that I am by <em>no means</em> a expert in anything you are about to read. I am also not 100% sure about the correct terminology for this type of patching. Maybe it should have been called binary patching? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that I was quite literally shocked by the ease of getting this job done, and figured its time to make some notes for me to reflect on later again.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/mRLYDs8.png"></p>

<p>Recently I had the opportunity to poke at an Android <code>.apk</code>. My task was a little different from what I am about to blog about, but the fundamental idea remained the same. I wanted to inspect some traffic of an application, but the application had jailbreak detection built in and refused to run if the device its running on is detected as jailbroken. This had to be bypassed first. To play with the <code>apk</code>, I needed to get some tools setup and learn a few things about the Android environment <em>really</em> fast. There are tons of resources available online to describe to you the general idea behind Android, as well as how its all stitched together. You will quickly come to realize that apps can be written in Java. For the purpose of this post, the focus is to bypass the jailbreak detection the <code>apk</code> had and let it continue normal operations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pegasus-1,109/">Pegasus 1</a> is a boot2root hosted on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a> built by <a href="https://twitter.com/theknapsy">@TheKnapsy</a>. He wrote a <a href="http://knapsy.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/pegasus-has-arrived-my-first-boot2root-vm/">blogpost</a> about it too containing a small introduction with Pegasus as his first boot2root (hoof2root? ;p).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/PI4O7Dp.png"> Having recently played in the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/playing-in-the-playground-a-offsec-virtual-pentesting-labs-review/">Offsec Playground</a> a little after having completed my OSCP, I was relatively exhausted. Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&hellip; <em>again</em>. You will see this in the <strong>my_first</strong> section.</p>

<p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!</p>

<p>Lets begin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you may know, I recently completed the Penetration testing with Kali Linux training and obtained OSCP certification. It was an amazing experience and really taught me more than just <em>&ldquo;hacking stuff&rdquo;</em>. Instead, the training came coupled with self discipline and endurance. By day I make a living in the IT security field, by night, I tinker, research and learn!</p>

<p>With PWK over, not long after that, I was privileged enough to be presented with a opportunity to beta test a new product that <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security</a> is planning to launch around January 2015 referred to as&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/6zVRGS6.jpg"> As I am writing this post, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; I have received the much awaited email confirming that I have successfully completed the OSCP Certification requirements!</p>

<p>In order to obtain OSCP Certification, one must complete some time in the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux labs followed by a grueling 24 hour exam challenge.</p>

<p>One really big realization that I came to was the fact that one should not attempt to do this if your goal is simply to get the OSCP Certification. Doing PWK is a excellent opportunity to learn and rushing it may cause you to not make it in the exam.</p>

<p>Below is a summary of my experience obtaining OSCP.</p>
