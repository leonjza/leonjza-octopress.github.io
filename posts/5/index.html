  <div class="entry-content"><h3>So there is a good use</h3>

<p>URL Shorteners, as they are most commonly known, are pretty useful in places where you are limited to the amount of characters you are allowed to type. Twitter being the prime example. However, it is not only because of services like that that these URL shortening services exist. Sometimes, URL&rsquo;s are are just plain crazy long, and very error prone when you have to copy and paste/link them someone. I guess we can call this a useful feature?</p>

<h3>And a bad use</h3>

<p>Of course, like most of the stuff you find on the internet, there has to be a way to abuse it too. Many people that consider themselves to be &ldquo;IT Literate&rdquo;, be it second nature, or they have been burned before, will usually check out the link they are about to click. URL Shortening services take this &ldquo;check&rdquo; right out. It is now easier to get someone to click on a url to <em>somedodywebsite.io/free_trojan_screensaver_no_virus_promise.exe</em> as by the time the page has loaded, it may very well be too late.</p>

<p>There are also concerns about tracking too. But that is a different debate all together.</p>

<h3>Rise of the URL Expander.</h3>

<p>There are tons, and I mean, <strong>tons</strong> of &lsquo;URL Expansion&rsquo; services available online. <a href="http://longurl.org/,">http://longurl.org/,</a> <a href="http://urlex.org/">http://urlex.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.wheredoesthislinkgo.com/">http://www.wheredoesthislinkgo.com/</a> to name a few. All from a simple Google Search. There are even browser plugins that would automatically &lsquo;expand&rsquo; urls  as you hover over them.</p>

<p>This is cool and all. But how do I know that those services are not modifying the URL&rsquo;s? How do I know the browser plugin is not also fooling around somehow? Does that sound pretty paranoid to you? Well&hellip; :D</p>

<h3>Time for longurl.py</h3>

<p>I wanted something to use on the command line, that would allow me to see <strong>exactly</strong> where I was going. Thus, <em>longurl.py</em> came to be.</p>

<p>Get the script with: <code>$ git clone https://github.com/th3l33k/longurl.git</code></p>

<p>With this, I am able to see each 30x type redirect, as well as where it will take me. A sample usage case would be:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can see each &lsquo;hop&rsquo; it would have taken, as well as have your &lsquo;check before click&rsquo; ability back. Like I said, there are lots of other ways to get the same thing done, but I preferred knowing exactly what is going on, rather than just getting the final URL, missing potential bad URL&rsquo;s in between that could lead to other <em>interesting</em> finding. :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
A similar effect can be seen with this one curl command:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Stuff to what&hellip;?</h3>

<p>Not too long ago, a colleague introduced me to Gource. In case you have not heard of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">Gource</a> before, I highly suggest you take a few minutes and check out the project home page <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">here</a>. If you have been developing, or are part of a development project that has been around a while, then Gource should be able to tell you a tale in a strangely mesmerising way about its progression. Go ahead, download and install it. You are going to need it to try the rest of the stuff anyways.</p>

<p><em>Be warned though, watching the output is highly addictive and strangely entertaining, so if you value your productivity, <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> continue reading this post.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gFkD3z5.png"></p>

<p>In short, Gource will take your repos commit logs from Git, Mecurial, SVN or even CVS (with some work) and splash out a graphical representation of the commits, by committer, across time. It also has a number of tweaks that allows you to change some visuals, focus on specific comitters and add titles etc.</p>

<p>You can also create a Gource &lsquo;movie&rsquo; by specifying the <code>-o</code> option for output. This will provide a sequence of screenshots in PPM format that can later be encoded using something like FFMPEG. Keep in mind that this output is <em>massive</em>. 5mins of output generated something like a 5GB .ppm file for me. You can also just pipe your Gource output directly into ffmpeg, skipping the need to create the .ppm as FFMPEG can read a stream. I of course have no idea how you&rsquo;d accomplish this in Windows, but ok ;D</p>

<p>Majong released a video of exactly this for the Minecraft dev tree. 800+ days worth of work, depicting the commit logs from a alpha 1.2 version through to the 1.5 release bought down 8 minutes. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRjTyRly5WA">Direct Link</a></p>

<h3>Taking it one step further.</h3>

<p>So all this is cool and stuff. Watching the stories of code get told in a uber cool fashion, causing a lot of productive time to be lost. However, browsing through the Gource Wiki Pages, revealed a rather interesting section. Gource accepts a argument called <code>--log-format custom</code> that allows you to generate, well, custom logs.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/CustomLogFormat">wiki documentation</a>, the format for a custom log entry needs to be pipe delimited and have the following format:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gource sample custom log</span><a href='https://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/CustomLogFormat'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># minimum custom log format</span>
</span><span class='line'>1275543595<span class="p">|</span>andrew<span class="p">|</span>A<span class="p">|</span>src/main.cpp
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># optionally, we can set a color value</span>
</span><span class='line'>1275543595<span class="p">|</span>andrew<span class="p">|</span>A<span class="p">|</span>src/main.cpp<span class="p">|</span>FF0000
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So this is, nice. Gource <em>also</em> accepts input from stdin, via <code>-</code> as input obviously. To sum this up. Any, correctly formatted, pipe delimited input can be accepted as a &lsquo;log&rsquo; entry, that Gource should understand. Lets try it out.</p>

<h3>Introducing py2gource.py</h3>

<p>My initial thought on this was that 90% if the custom log formats could be generated on the shell. Rightfully so. With tools like <strong>awk</strong> and <strong>sed</strong>, you can do some pretty neat stuff. However, as powerful as they may be, the approach of writing some middleware that would do all of the parsing and log generation <em>for</em> me, seemed like a better idea. And so, <code>py2gource.py</code> was born. Another terribly coded piece of python to do things I am too lazy to do in any other way.</p>

<p>So far based on what has been coded, the basic idea to use this middleware in a very simple form is: <code>cat something | python py2gource.py | gource</code></p>

<h3>Gource for&hellip; Nmap?</h3>

<p>But, we don&rsquo;t have to <code>cat</code> something for output, right. Just do <code>nmap 127.0.0.1 -v | python py2gource.py | gource</code>. <code>py2gource.py</code> will happily read <em>stdin</em> and parse the output for input formats it understands, specified by <code>-t</code> as needed. For example:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>From the above example we can see that the verbose Nmap output has been parsed to be complaint to the custom log format as per the Gource wiki. So, lets pipe this to gource:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Nmap to gource</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>nmap -v 192.168.137.0/24 <span class="p">|</span> python py2gource.py -t nmap <span class="p">|</span> gource --realtime --log-format custom - -1440x900 --bloom-intensity 0.3 -e 0.2 -i 120 --title <span class="s2">&quot;Nmap of 192.168.137.0/24&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should now have a Gource window pop up, with your Nmap results being displayed in a similar fashion as you saw in the Minecraft example. The above command completes the 3 parts required to get output to Gource using the middleware. Granted in the Nmap case, the parser will just not output anything if the IP or IP range that you are scanning has no open ports, or, you forgot to specify the <code>-v</code> argument. <em>This requirement may change later</em>.</p>

<p>Seeing the Nmap scan come alive is pretty cool. It almost convinces one to scan all the things, just to watch the pretty pictures!</p>

<h3>Visualising a Network Telescope</h3>

<p>Where I am currently employed, I am fortunate enough to have access to the data our blackhole provides to us. The setup is pretty simple. There are 13, random /24&rsquo;s (IPV6 coming soon™), sink holed to a box running the <a href="http://qosient.com/argus/">Argus</a> server software. Argus provides a set of client tools that you can use to connect to the server and &lsquo;see&rsquo; what is happening, live.</p>

<p>This was a golden opportunity to add a parser that would parse the output this client receives into Gource. The result? See for yourself:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eDc3EPlh.png"></p>

<p>Moments later, even more activity&hellip; :)</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yPAGoLwh.png"></p>

<p>The parser will take the Argus client output and split the results of the IPv4 destination address by octet. Each octet will form part of the tree structure. Each bubble represents a port that was touched. Finally, each full destination IP address will get its own <em>unique</em> colour, so it will be easy to see when a specific IP has been scanned across multiple ports. Each <em>user</em> is a source IP address. Remember, this is IP space that is used for nothing other than seeing what is happening on it. So things like people scanning your Darknet for open SSH ports will make your Gource go mad, in a good way ofc.</p>

<p>The above screenshots were taken by specifying the <code>--hide dirnames</code> arguments, as we obviously want to try and keep the IP space of the blackhole classified.</p>

<h3>Ok, how did you do THAT</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Visualising the Argus Darknet with Gource</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>~/Downloads/argus-clients-3.0.6.2/bin/ra -S <span class="o">[</span>argus_server<span class="o">]</span>:<span class="o">[</span>argus_port<span class="o">]</span> -n <span class="p">|</span> tee raw <span class="p">|</span> python py2gource.py -t argus <span class="p">|</span> tee parsed <span class="p">|</span> gource --realtime --log-format custom - -1440x900 --bloom-intensity 0.3 --title <span class="s2">&quot;Live Darknet Port Activity&quot;</span> -i 30 -f
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I am going to assume you have the Argus server setup complete, and you are able to connect using the <code>ra</code> client. For more information on setting it up, refer to the Argus wiki <a href="http://nsmwiki.org/index.php?title=Argus">here</a>. Which ever machine your using to run Gource on, obviously needs to be able to connect as well.</p>

<p>The Argus parser works without specifying any fancy command line options. I have used <code>-n</code> in the example as I did not want to have the destination port names, but the raw port numbers instead. This output is piped into <code>tee</code>, that will write the output to the file <em>raw</em> as well as stdout. This is not a requirement, but its interesting to see <strong>what</strong> is being parsed. I tail the file in a separate terminal usually and inspect the output. Then the output is passed to <code>py2gource.py</code> with the type set to argus via <code>-t argus</code>. The output generated by this middleware is then finally &lsquo;tee&rsquo;d&rsquo; and sent to Gource, which is configured to accept input in realtime from stdin with <code>--realtime --log-format custom -</code>. The rest of the options I used in the example for Gource is purely graphically related.</p>

<p>The file <em>parsed</em> can be seen as a &lsquo;history&rsquo; file that can be piped into Gource again at a later time to replay potentially interesting events, or, if you are not able to connect directly to argus, and need to grab and parse output on one machine, and then replay on another machine with Gource installed.</p>

<h3>Get the code, setup your own.</h3>

<p>The parser&rsquo;s code is hosted on Github <a href="https://github.com/th3l33k/py2gource">here</a>. Grab the code with <code>git clone https://github.com/th3l33k/py2gource.git</code>. Parsers live in <code>lib/Parsers</code> if you are interested in parsing some other interesting information you may have.</p>

<p>Have fun! :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Lets start by saying that I am by <em>no</em> means an expert at any of what I am about to write. Primarily this post is purely for research purposes. Think of it as one of those <em>something to do</em> scenarios. I&rsquo;d like to cover some basics around HTTP Authentication, and then show a PoC of how this can be abused in a real world scenario. Hopefully this will help educate people to use more secure authentication mechanisms! :)</p>

<h3>Authentication at a HTTP Level</h3>

<p>HTTP Level authentication, for the most part, rely on a set of headers to authenticate the user. Generally speaking, the server will present the expected authentication mechanism via a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header, and expect the client to prepare the correct response back. Each request the user makes after a successful authentication attempt, has to contain the correct headers for the applicable authentication scheme, else the server would normally respond with a <code>401 - Not Authorised</code>, and the client has to re-authenticate. It is up to the server/application to validate the headers on each request.
HTTP level authentication mechanisms include <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#section-2">Basic</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#section-3">Digest</a> as well as more complex schemes such as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559">Kerberos</a>, <a href="http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html#ntlmHttpAuthentication">NTLM</a> and <a href="http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#auth_header">OAuth</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that even though you are using say, Digest authentication, it is entirely up to the backend systems to <strong>validate</strong> the credentials. Whether it is some backend database, RADIUS server, LDAP etc. that stores your valid set of credentials does not matter. The server and the client, on a HTTP level, will be exchanging these headers.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this article, I will focus a little on the arguably less complex mechanisms, Basic and Digest.</p>

<h3>HTTP Basic Authentication</h3>

<p>Basic authentication is considered the <em>least secure</em> method of HTTP authentication. Why is this exactly? Well, the credentials used to authenticate you as a user is sent over the wire in a Base64 encoded string. Base64 is a <strong>encoding</strong> scheme, and <strong>not</strong> an encryption scheme [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">1</a>].</p>

<p>To demonstrate this, lets assume we have a website that wants to make use of basic authentication. A sample request header would look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,af;q=0.6</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>The website, configured to use basic authentication, will see that there is no <code>Authorisation</code> header presented by the client, and respond with a <code>401</code>, as well as a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorised

<p>The response we got when attempting to access the website told us that we need to provide a authentication response first. Based on the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header, this mechanism should be <code>Basic</code> for the realm <em>Basic Auth Testing</em>. Don&rsquo;t stress too much about the realm part. In short, this is usually used to give the user a short message like &ldquo;Restricted Area&rdquo; etc.
In the authentication dialog that the browser presents, we provide some credentials, and submit them for processing. Your browser now goes and prepares the <code>Authorisation</code> header.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Because my credentials are correct, the server will respond now with a <code>200</code> and serve the content. But, lets take a quick step back and check out what is actually in this header. More specifically, check out the <code>Authorisation: Basic dXNlci5uYW1lOnMzY3IzdFBAc3N3MHJk</code> part.
This header now needs to be present in every request that is made to the website. If for whatever reason the credentials are no longer valid, the server/application will usually respond with a <code>401</code> again, and the authentication will re-occur. The user normally does not have to do anything, as the browser will automatically include the Authorization header in every request.</p>

<h4>Ok, so what?</h4>

<p>So lets take a moment and relook at the <code>Authorisation</code> header. <code>Authorisation: Basic dXNlci5uYW1lOnMzY3IzdFBAc3N3MHJk</code>
Lets strip the <em>Authorisation: Basic</em> section and just work with the <code>dXNlci5uYW1lOnMzY3IzdFBAc3N3MHJk</code>. We will echo this, and pipe it through a base64 decoder in a shell session:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>user.name:s3cr3tP@ssw0rd
</span><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yup, thats it&hellip;</p>

<p>It is now clear to see that for HTTP Basic authentication, the browser will take the credentials that the user has provided, and create the header in the format:
<code>Authorisation: Basic</code> + <strong>base64(username:password)</strong>. If you are protecting a non-SSL web resource with this authentication mechanism, you are essentially asking your users to send their credentials unencrypted over the wire to you for every requset.</p>

<h3>HTTP Digest Authentication</h3>

<p>Digest authentication is considered to be <em>more</em> secure, as it actually applies a hash function to the credentials, before passing the header on to the server. For the sake of brevity, lets assume the server will act in a similar fashion to the Basic Authentication example above, except, the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> and <code>Authorisation</code> headers are completely different. You are of course welcome to check it out yourself, and I would encourage you do so!</p>

<p>Lets look at an example, and then dig into the details. Requesting a digest protected web resource @<em>/login</em> without a valid <code>Authorisation</code> header, will cause our sample application to respond with a <code>401</code> and a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>WWW-Authenticate: Digest <span class="nv">realm</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;test.dev&quot;</span>,qop<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;auth&quot;</span>,nonce<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;064af982c5b571cea6450d8eda91c20d&quot;</span>,opaque<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;d8ea7aa61a1693024c4cc3a516f49b3c&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Just as the Basic example, the browser will prompt the user for credentials now and prepare the response. The response then to the server would include the following <code>Authorisation</code> header:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Authorisation: Digest <span class="nv">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;user.name&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">realm</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;test.dev&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">nonce</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;064af982c5b571cea6450d8eda91c20d&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">uri</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/login&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">response</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;70eda34f1683041fd9ab72056c51b740&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">opaque</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;d8ea7aa61a1693024c4cc3a516f49b3c&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">qop</span><span class="o">=</span>auth, <span class="nv">nc</span><span class="o">=</span>00000001, <span class="nv">cnonce</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;61417766e50cb980&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Clearly the response here is much more complex when compared to the Basic example. So, lets refer to the Wikipedia Article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication#Overview">here</a>, or the official RFC <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2069#section-2.1.2">here</a> to help us understand what is going on here.</p>

<p>According to the Wikipedia article, the response <code>Authorisation</code> header for Digest authentication for <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#section-3.2.2">RFC 2617</a> is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>So, lets take this formula, step by step and try and replicate the response <code>Authorisation</code> header in a shell. If one of the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> headers don&rsquo;t make sense then I&rsquo;ll highly reccomend you read the RFC.</p>

<p><code>70eda34f1683041fd9ab72056c51b740</code> is the valid <code>response</code> header for this request. Note that the next client request will set <code>nc=00000002</code> and therefore the response will be different due to this value being part of the response calculation. However, the fact remains that the authorisation is continuously done via header exchanges between the client and the server, relying on the server to validate them.</p>

<p>It is also clear that this can not be easily reversed. Even though some attributes that make up the hash function are known, the username and password are at least hashed and factored into the response attribute. It is not impossible, though not as easy as Basic authentication.</p>

<h3>O..K.. so I now get how the Basic vs Digest stuff works, whats next?</h3>

<p>What if we could make the browser think that the server wants basic authentication, and then capture the encdoded credentials? That would mean we dont need any l33t cracking skeelz or anything. Just a <code>base64 -d</code>.</p>

<h3>Downgrade all the auth!</h3>

<p>Assuming you are able to get some form of MiTM between the client and the server, by whichever means you use, we can intercept the headers and change them to tell the browser that we actually want basic authentication. Remember, the browser responds based on what the server asks, so if the server only asks for Basic authentication&hellip; :D</p>

<p>&ldquo;Downgrade&rdquo; attacks are a known flaw in Digest authentication. Where Digest authentication is not necessarily vulnerable to MiTM attacks in the sense that the hash still needs to be cracked, Basic authentication is and therefore such an attack can prove to be valuable to an attacker.</p>

<h3>Enough talk, PoC!</h3>

<p>Using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/proxpy/">proxpy</a>, which is a pluggable python proxy server, I wrote a PoC demoing this exact attack. There are a lot of scenarios where this doesn&rsquo;t work very well, but this is only meant to demonstrate the problem.</p>

<p>Lets get to it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At the core, this authentication downgrade attack PoC leverages off the ability to perform a MiTM between the client and server. How you get this MiTM is out of the scope of this article, but bear in mind that MiTM is not <strong>just</strong> arp spoofing clients. You could NAT web traffic to your proxy too&hellip; :)</p></li>
<li><p>Download <a href="https://code.google.com/p/proxpy/">proxpy</a> and extract it to a working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Download and save the plugin from <a href="https://gist.github.com/th3l33k/5868963/raw/8b20c879ad68cd46fd470b86f9bdc7f33da4b097/dtob.py">here</a> into the <code>plugins/</code> directory in your proxpy working directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the proxy, specifying the port you&rsquo;d like it to run on, as well as telling it to load the plugin.
A sample command to get this running would be: <code>python proxpy.py -p 8090 -x plugins/dtob.py</code></p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that your MiTM is successful, and watch as digest authentication gets downgraded to basic auth, and your credentials echoed to the terminal :P Something like this&hellip;</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>What is the user experience with this?</h3>

<p>That is a good question. The actual dialog that the user sees, again, is up to the browser to render. Depending on <strong>which</strong> browser you use on <strong>which</strong> OS, this may look different. In the back, the client <em>should</em> function normally, blissfully unaware that the headers for stronger authentication were swapped out.</p>

<p>On my computer, the authentication dialog has the follow look and feel:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9NTWg0W.png"></p>

<p>Notice the &ldquo;Server Says:&rdquo; Section. This is typically the <code>realm</code> part of the authentication request. When using the <code>dtob.py</code> plugin, it is changed to <code>pwnd</code>. This dialog looks no different when using any form of HTTP based authentication. Hence, when the downgrade attack occurs, the user is unaware that anything different is happening in the background.</p>

<h3>To wrap it up</h3>

<p>A few things to note here. Regardless of the HTTP Authentication method used, the client will not know <em>which</em> authentication method is actually being used without inspecting the headers etc. The plugin can technically be written to keep track of which URL&rsquo;s require Digest auth, and prepare valid responses ( like the one we did in the shell ) and present that back to the server. This will make the process completely smooth and the client unaware that something is going on. In the plugins current state, it will just continuously prompt the user for authentication as the proper request with the correct <code>Authorisation</code> header is never sent to the server.</p>

<p>On the case of SSL websites it obviously gets a little more tricky. Don&rsquo;t be put off with this. <strong>Countless</strong> times have I seen where users simply click the &ldquo;proceed anyways&rdquo; button regardless of the certificate validation errors that the browser presents them with. So, even though you will raise alarms on SSL encrypted websites, its still worth a try ^^</p>
