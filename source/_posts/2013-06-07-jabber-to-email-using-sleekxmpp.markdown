### So, why would you even want this..?
Well, to be honest, I am not really sure of many use cases for this, however maybe someone, somewhere will need to do something like this, and I would have done my deed and saved someone some time ::sun::

### Introducing SleekXMPP
[SleekXMPP](http://sleekxmpp.com/) is a python XMPP framework. It takes a bit to get your head around it, but once you have some basics covered its quite a rewarding library to work with. :) To start, you need to install 2 dependencies. Python Mailer and SleekXMPP itself. Something like `pip install mailer sleekxmpp` or for the older school, `easy_install sleekxmpp mailer` should do the trick. It can't hurt to check if the distro you use has these are packages already too.

<!--more-->

### Configuration and testing time
Once the install completes, do a quick check to see if everything is ok, Try to import the modules. They should return no errors. If they do, check that the installation of the previously mentioned dependencies were successful.

```python Check dependencies
% python2
Python 2.7.5 (default, May 12 2013, 12:00:47)
[GCC 4.8.0 20130502 (prerelease)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sleekxmpp
>>> import mailer
>>>
```

Next, you need a *bot* account to use. Provision a user on your jabber server for the bot and test with a jabber client that it works.

### Ok, code
Next, we take the [sample](http://sleekxmpp.com/#here-s-your-first-sleekxmpp-bot) echobot from the SleekXMPP website, and modify it slightly to handle our incoming message by sending a email, instead of simply replying back what we have sent.

First, we import the mailer requirements with:

```python mailer imports

from mailer import Mailer
from mailer import Message
```

The above can be placed right after the option parser has been imported. Then, we only need to change the `message` method within the `EchoBot` class really:

```python Shameless SleekXMPP modification of the echobot http://sleekxmpp.com/#here-s-your-first-sleekxmpp-bot
#!/usr/bin/env python
if msg['type'] in ('chat', 'normal'):

   print "Received Message:\n%(body)s" % msg

   # Mail the message Received
   message = Message(From="'Jabber Email Service' <someone@domain.com>",
         To=["someone@domain.com"],
         Subject="[Jabber Message Received] From: %s" % msg["from"])
   themessage = msg["body"]
   themessage = themessage.decode('unicode_escape').encode('ascii','ignore')
   message.Body = themessage

   sender = Mailer("127.0.0.1")
   sender.send(message)
```

A complete modified example that includes the above changes:

```python Shameless SleekXMPP modification of the echobot http://sleekxmpp.com/#here-s-your-first-sleekxmpp-bot
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

### So how do I actually use this thing I just saw?
Take the complete example and save it to a file like `bot.py`. Then, run it!
The complete example will echo the message just before it attempts to mail it. You can comment out line **86** to stop this from happening and run the script with the `-q` argument once you are happy all is working.

```bash sample run
% python bot.py -j "myEmailbot@myJabberServer.local"
Password:
INFO     Negotiating TLS
INFO     Using SSL version: 3
INFO     CERT: Time until certificate expiration: 952 days, 6:46:01.014041

Received Message:
This is a test message that will be mailed :D
```

### Things to note.
- Even though the script allows you to specify a `-p` argument, I would highly discourage the usage of this. Any person that has access to your machine, be it legitimate or not, would then see your bot's process, with the password in the `ps` output!
- Ensure the SMTP server specified in line **96** of the complete example allows yo to relay! Change it if needed.

### Test! :D
Send your bot a message and see if your mail arrives ^^

**EDIT**: Modify the message encoding to ASCII as the utf8 stuff seems to barf out sometimes :|
